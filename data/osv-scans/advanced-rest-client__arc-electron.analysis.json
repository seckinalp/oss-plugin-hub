      "details": "### Impact\nThe `nativeImage.createFromPath()` and `nativeImage.createFromBuffer()` functions call a function downstream that is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow. An Electron program that uses either of the affected functions is vulnerable to a buffer overflow if an attacker is in control of the image's height, width, and contents.\n\n### Workaround\nThere are no app-side workarounds for this issue. You must update your Electron version to be protected.\n\n### Patches\n\n- `v28.3.2`\n- `v29.3.3`\n- `v30.0.3`\n\n### For More Information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, email us at [security@electronjs.org](mailto:security@electronjs.org).",

This is roughly equivalent to any sort of improper escaping vulnerability, with the caveat that the attacker must find a way to observe other Math.random() values generated by the application to solve for the state of the PRNG. However, Math.random() is used in all sorts of places that might be visible to an attacker (including by form-data itself, if the attacker can arrange for the vulnerable application to make a request to an attacker-controlled server using form-data, such as a user-controlled webhook -- the attacker could observe the boundary values from those requests to observe the Math.random() outputs). A common example would be a `x-request-id` header added by the server. These sorts of headers are often used for distributed tracing, to correlate errors across the frontend and backend. `Math.random()` is a fine place to get these sorts of IDs (in fact, [opentelemetry uses Math.random for this purpose](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/blob/2053f0d3a44631ade77ea04f656056a2c8a2ae76/packages/opentelemetry-sdk-trace-base/src/platform/node/RandomIdGenerator.ts#L22))\n\n### PoC\n\nPoC here: https://github.com/benweissmann/CVE-2025-7783-poc\n\nInstructions are in that repo.

The attacker must be able to do something malicious by adding extra parameters (that were not intended to be user-controlled) to this request. Depending on the target system's handling of repeated parameters, the attacker might be able to overwrite values in addition to appending values (some multipart form handlers deal with repeats by overwriting values instead of representing them as an array)\n- Reveal values of Math.random(). It's easiest if the attacker can observe multiple sequential values, but more complex math could recover the PRNG state to some degree of confidence with non-sequential values. \n\nIf an application is vulnerable, this allows an attacker to make arbitrary requests to internal systems.",

If your application is sandboxed then `nodeIntegrationInSubFrames` just gives access to the sandboxed renderer APIs (which includes `ipcRenderer`).\n\nIf your application then additionally exposes IPC messages without IPC `senderFrame` validation that perform privileged actions or return confidential data this access to `ipcRenderer` can in turn compromise your application / user even with the sandbox enabled.\n\n### Patches\nThis has been patched and the following Electron versions contain the fix:\n\n* `18.0.0-beta.6`\n* `17.2.0`\n* `16.2.6`\n* `15.5.5`\n\n### Workarounds\nEnsure that all IPC message handlers appropriately validate `senderFrame` as per our [security tutorial here](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/main/docs/tutorial/security.md#17-validate-the-sender-of-all-ipc-messages).\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, email us at [security@electronjs.org](mailto:security@electronjs.org).",

The contents of the file is not available to the renderer following the redirect, but if the redirect target is a SMB URL such as `file://some.website.com/`, then in some cases, Windows will connect to that server and attempt NTLM authentication, which can include sending hashed credentials.\n\n### Patches\nThis issue has been fixed in all current stable versions of Electron. Specifically, these versions contain the fixes:\n\n- 21.0.0-beta.1\n- 20.0.1\n- 19.0.11\n- 18.3.7\n\nWe recommend all apps upgrade to the latest stable version of Electron.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf upgrading isn't possible, this issue can be addressed without upgrading by preventing redirects to file:// URLs in the `WebContents.on('will-redirect')` event, for all WebContents:\n\n```js\napp.on('web-contents-created', (e, webContents) => {\n  webContents.on('will-redirect', (e, url) => {\n    if (/^file:/.test(url)) e.preventDefault()\n  })\n})\n```\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, email us at [security@electronjs.org](mailto:security@electronjs.org).\n\n### Credit\nThanks to user @coolcoolnoworries for reporting this issue.",

      "details": "### Impact\nApps using `contextIsolation` and `contextBridge` are affected.\n\nThis is a context isolation bypass, meaning that code running in the main world context in the renderer can reach into the isolated Electron context and perform privileged actions.\n\n### Workarounds\nThis issue is exploitable under either of two conditions:\n* If an API exposed to the main world via `contextBridge` can return an object or array that contains a JS object which cannot be serialized, for instance, a canvas rendering context. This would normally result in an exception being thrown `Error: object could not be cloned`.\n* If an API exposed to the main world via `contextBridge` has a return value that throws a user-generated exception while being sent over the bridge, for instance a dynamic getter property on an object that throws an error when being computed.\n\nThe app side workaround is to ensure that such a case is not possible. Ensure all values returned from a function exposed over the context bridge are [supported](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/context-bridge#parameter--error--return-type-support) and that any objects returned from functions do not have dynamic getters that can throw exceptions.\n\nAuditing your exposed API is likely to be quite difficult so we strongly recommend you update to a patched version of Electron.\n\n### Fixed Versions\n* `25.0.0-alpha.2`\n* `24.0.1`\n* `23.2.3`\n* `22.3.6`\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, email us at [security@electronjs.org](mailto:security@electronjs.org)",

Apps without these fuses enabled are not impacted.\n\nSpecifically this issue can only be exploited if your app is launched from a filesystem the attacker has write access too.  i.e. the ability to edit files inside the `resources` folder in your app installation on Windows which these fuses are supposed to protect against.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere are no app side workarounds, you must update to a patched version of Electron.\n\n### Fixed Versions\n* `38.0.0-beta.6`\n* `37.3.1`\n* `36.8.1`\n* `35.7.5`\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, email us at [security@electronjs.org](mailto:security@electronjs.org)",

It executes the following command in a new shell (`process.env.ComSpec` on Windows, usually `C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe`):\n\nhttps://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/blob/140e2f0eb0df79c2a46e35024e96d0563355fc89/packages/electron-updater/src/windowsExecutableCodeSignatureVerifier.ts#L35-L41\n\nBecause of the surrounding shell, a first pass by `cmd.exe` expands any environment variable found in command-line above.\n\n### Exploitation\n\nThis creates a situation where `verifySignature()` can be tricked into validating the certificate of a different file than the one that was just downloaded. If the step is successful, the malicious update will be executed even if its signature is invalid. \n\n### Impact\n\nThis attack assumes a compromised update manifest (server compromise, Man-in-the-Middle attack if fetched over HTTP, Cross-Site Scripting to point the application to a malicious updater server, etc.).\n\n### Patch\n\nThis vulnerability was patched in #8295, by comparing the path in the output of `Get-AuthenticodeSignature` with the intended one. The patch is available starting from 6.3.0-alpha.6.",

The attacker serves a malicious web page (`http://malicious.example.com`).\n1. The user accesses the malicious web page.\n1. The attacker sends a `fetch('http://127.0.0.1:8000/main.js')` request by JS in that malicious web page. This request is normally blocked by same-origin policy, but that's not the case for the reasons above.\n1. The attacker gets the content of `http://127.0.0.1:8000/main.js`.\n\nIn this scenario, I assumed that the attacker knows the URL of the bundle output file name. But the attacker can also get that information by\n\n- Fetching `/index.html`: normally you have a script tag here\n- Fetching `/assets`: it's common to have a `assets` directory when you have JS files and CSS files in a different directory and the directory listing feature tells the attacker the list of files\n- Connecting `/esbuild` SSE endpoint: the SSE endpoint sends the URL path of the changed files when the file is changed (`new EventSource('/esbuild').addEventListener('change', e => console.log(e.type, e.data))`)\n- Fetching URLs in the known file: once the attacker knows one file, the attacker can know the URLs imported from that file\n\nThe scenario above fetches the compiled content, but if the victim has the source map option enabled, the attacker can also get the non-compiled content by fetching the source map file.\n\n### PoC\n\n1. Download [reproduction.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18561484/reproduction.zip)\n2. Extract it and move to that directory\n1. Run `npm i`\n1. Run `npm run watch`\n1. Run `fetch('http://127.0.0.1:8000/app.js').then(r => r.text()).then(content => console.log(content))` in a different website's dev tools.\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08fc2e4d-e1ec-44ca-b0ea-78a73c3c40e9)\n\n### Impact\n\nUsers using the serve feature may get the source code stolen by malicious websites.",

      "summary": "Babel has inefficient RegExp complexity in generated code with .replace when transpiling named capturing groups",
      "details": "### Impact\n\nWhen using Babel to compile [regular expression named capturing groups](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Named_capturing_group), Babel will generate a polyfill for the `.replace` method that has quadratic complexity on some specific replacement pattern strings (i.e. the second argument passed to `.replace`).\n\nYour generated code is vulnerable if _all_ the following conditions are true:\n- You use Babel to compile [regular expression named capturing groups](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Named_capturing_group)\n- You use the `.replace` method on a regular expression that contains named capturing groups\n- **Your code uses untrusted strings as the second argument of `.replace`**\n\nIf you are using `@babel/preset-env` with the [`targets`](https://babeljs.io/docs/options#targets) option, the transform that injects the vulnerable code is automatically enabled if:\n- you use [_duplicated_ named capturing groups](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-duplicate-named-capturing-groups), and target any browser older than Chrome/Edge 126, Opera 112, Firefox 129, Safari 17.4, or Node.js 23\n- you use any [named capturing groups](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Named_capturing_group), and target any browser older than Chrome 64, Opera 71, Edge 79, Firefox 78, Safari 11.1, or Node.js 10\n\nYou can verify what transforms `@babel/preset-env` is using by enabling the [`debug` option](https://babeljs.io/docs/babel-preset-env#debug).\n\n\n### Patches\n\nThis problem has been fixed in `@babel/helpers` and `@babel/runtime` 7.26.10 and 8.0.0-alpha.17, please upgrade. It's likely that you do not directly depend on `@babel/helpers`, and instead you depend on `@babel/core` (which itself depends on `@babel/helpers`). Upgrading to `@babel/core` 7.26.10 is not required, but it guarantees that you are on a new enough `@babel/helpers` version.\n\nPlease note that just updating your Babel dependencies is not enough: you will also need to re-compile your code.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you are passing user-provided strings as the second argument of `.replace` on regular expressions that contain named capturing groups, validate the input and make sure it does not contain the substring `$<` if it's then not followed by `>` (possibly with other characters in between).\n\n### References\n\nThis vulnerability was reported and fixed in https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/17173.",

      "details": "The `parse` method of the JSON5 library before and including version `2.2.1` does not restrict parsing of keys named `__proto__`, allowing specially crafted strings to pollute the prototype of the resulting object.\n\nThis vulnerability pollutes the prototype of the object returned by `JSON5.parse` and not the global Object prototype, which is the commonly understood definition of Prototype Pollution. However, polluting the prototype of a single object can have significant security impact for an application if the object is later used in trusted operations.\n\n## Impact\nThis vulnerability could allow an attacker to set arbitrary and unexpected keys on the object returned from `JSON5.parse`. The actual impact will depend on how applications utilize the returned object and how they filter unwanted keys, but could include denial of service, cross-site scripting, elevation of privilege, and in extreme cases, remote code execution.\n\n## Mitigation\nThis vulnerability is patched in json5 v2.2.2 and later. A patch has also been backported for json5 v1 in versions v1.0.2 and later.\n\n## Details\n \nSuppose a developer wants to allow users and admins to perform some risky operation, but they want to restrict what non-admins can do. To accomplish this, they accept a JSON blob from the user, parse it using `JSON5.parse`, confirm that the provided data does not set some sensitive keys, and then performs the risky operation using the validated data:\n \n```js\nconst JSON5 = require('json5');\n\nconst doSomethingDangerous = (props) => {\n  if (props.isAdmin) {\n    console.log('Doing dangerous thing as admin.');\n  } else {\n    console.log('Doing dangerous thing as user.');\n  }\n};\n\nconst secCheckKeysSet = (obj, searchKeys) => {\n  let searchKeyFound = false;\n  Object.keys(obj).forEach((key) => {\n    if (searchKeys.indexOf(key) > -1) {\n      searchKeyFound = true;\n    }\n  });\n  return searchKeyFound;\n};\n\nconst props = JSON5.parse('{\"foo\": \"bar\"}');\nif (!secCheckKeysSet(props, ['isAdmin', 'isMod'])) {\n  doSomethingDangerous(props); // \"Doing dangerous thing as user.\"\n} else {\n  throw new Error('Forbidden...');\n}\n```\n \nIf the user attempts to set the `isAdmin` key, their request will be rejected:\n \n```js\nconst props = JSON5.parse('{\"foo\": \"bar\", \"isAdmin\": true}');\nif (!secCheckKeysSet(props, ['isAdmin', 'isMod'])) {\n  doSomethingDangerous(props);\n} else {\n  throw new Error('Forbidden...'); // Error: Forbidden...\n}\n```\n \nHowever, users can instead set the `__proto__` key to `{\"isAdmin\": true}`. `JSON5` will parse this key and will set the `isAdmin` key on the prototype of the returned object, allowing the user to bypass the security check and run their request as an admin:\n \n```js\nconst props = JSON5.parse('{\"foo\": \"bar\", \"__proto__\": {\"isAdmin\": true}}');\nif (!secCheckKeysSet(props, ['isAdmin', 'isMod'])) {\n  doSomethingDangerous(props); // \"Doing dangerous thing as admin.\"\n} else {\n  throw new Error('Forbidden...');\n}\n ```",

The vulnerability occurs in `micromatch.braces()` in `index.js` because the pattern `.*` will greedily match anything. By passing a malicious payload, the pattern matching will keep backtracking to the input while it doesn't find the closing bracket. As the input size increases, the consumption time will also increase until it causes the application to hang or slow down. There was a merged fix but further testing shows the issue persisted prior to https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch/pull/266. This issue should be mitigated by using a safe pattern that won't start backtracking the regular expression due to greedy matching.\n",

However, if you are relying on node-fetch to gate files above a size, the impact could be significant, for example: If you don't double-check the size of the data after `fetch()` has completed, your JS thread could get tied up doing work on a large file (DoS) and/or cost you money in computing.\n\n### Patches\nWe released patched versions for both stable and beta channels:\n\n- For `v2`: 2.6.1\n- For `v3`: 3.0.0-beta.9\n\n### Workarounds\nNone, it is strongly recommended to update as soon as possible.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [node-fetch](https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch/issues/new?assignees=&labels=question&template=support-or-usage.md&title=Question%3A+)\n* Contact one of the core maintainers.",

As long as the custom regular expression does not match the text before the parameter, you will be safe. For example, change `/:a-:b` to `/:a-:b([^-/]+)`.\n\nIf paths cannot be rewritten and versions cannot be upgraded, another alternative is to limit the URL length. For example, halving the attack string improves performance by 4x faster.\n\n### Details\n\nUsing `/:a-:b` will produce the regular expression `/^\\/([^\\/]+?)-([^\\/]+?)\\/?$/`. This can be exploited by a path such as `/a${'-a'.repeat(8_000)}/a`. [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS) has a good example of why this occurs, but the TL;DR is the `/a` at the end ensures this route would never match but due to naive backtracking it will still attempt every combination of the `:a-:b` on the repeated 8,000 `-a`.\n\nBecause JavaScript is single threaded and regex matching runs on the main thread, poor performance will block the event loop and can lead to a DoS. In local benchmarks, exploiting the unsafe regex will result in performance that is over 1000x worse than the safe regex. In a more realistic environment using Express v4 and 10 concurrent connections, this translated to average latency of ~600ms vs 1ms.\n\n### References\n\n* [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS)\n* [Detailed blog post](https://blakeembrey.com/posts/2024-09-web-redos/)",

In a more realistic environment using Express v4 and 10 concurrent connections, this translated to average latency of ~600ms vs 1ms.\n\n### References\n\n* [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS)\n* [Detailed blog post](https://blakeembrey.com/posts/2024-09-web-redos/)",

      "details": "### Impact\n\nWhen using Babel to compile [regular expression named capturing groups](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Named_capturing_group), Babel will generate a polyfill for the `.replace` method that has quadratic complexity on some specific replacement pattern strings (i.e. the second argument passed to `.replace`).\n\nYour generated code is vulnerable if _all_ the following conditions are true:\n- You use Babel to compile [regular expression named capturing groups](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Named_capturing_group)\n- You use the `.replace` method on a regular expression that contains named capturing groups\n- **Your code uses untrusted strings as the second argument of `.replace`**\n\nIf you are using `@babel/preset-env` with the [`targets`](https://babeljs.io/docs/options#targets) option, the transform that injects the vulnerable code is automatically enabled if:\n- you use [_duplicated_ named capturing groups](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-duplicate-named-capturing-groups), and target any browser older than Chrome/Edge 126, Opera 112, Firefox 129, Safari 17.4, or Node.js 23\n- you use any [named capturing groups](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Named_capturing_group), and target any browser older than Chrome 64, Opera 71, Edge 79, Firefox 78, Safari 11.1, or Node.js 10\n\nYou can verify what transforms `@babel/preset-env` is using by enabling the [`debug` option](https://babeljs.io/docs/babel-preset-env#debug).\n\n\n### Patches\n\nThis problem has been fixed in `@babel/helpers` and `@babel/runtime` 7.26.10 and 8.0.0-alpha.17, please upgrade. It's likely that you do not directly depend on `@babel/helpers`, and instead you depend on `@babel/core` (which itself depends on `@babel/helpers`). Upgrading to `@babel/core` 7.26.10 is not required, but it guarantees that you are on a new enough `@babel/helpers` version.\n\nPlease note that just updating your Babel dependencies is not enough: you will also need to re-compile your code.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you are passing user-provided strings as the second argument of `.replace` on regular expressions that contain named capturing groups, validate the input and make sure it does not contain the substring `$<` if it's then not followed by `>` (possibly with other characters in between).\n\n### References\n\nThis vulnerability was reported and fixed in https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/17173.",

      "details": "### Impact\n\nWhen using Babel to compile [regular expression named capturing groups](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Named_capturing_group), Babel will generate a polyfill for the `.replace` method that has quadratic complexity on some specific replacement pattern strings (i.e. the second argument passed to `.replace`).\n\nYour generated code is vulnerable if _all_ the following conditions are true:\n- You use Babel to compile [regular expression named capturing groups](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Named_capturing_group)\n- You use the `.replace` method on a regular expression that contains named capturing groups\n- **Your code uses untrusted strings as the second argument of `.replace`**\n\nIf you are using `@babel/preset-env` with the [`targets`](https://babeljs.io/docs/options#targets) option, the transform that injects the vulnerable code is automatically enabled if:\n- you use [_duplicated_ named capturing groups](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-duplicate-named-capturing-groups), and target any browser older than Chrome/Edge 126, Opera 112, Firefox 129, Safari 17.4, or Node.js 23\n- you use any [named capturing groups](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Named_capturing_group), and target any browser older than Chrome 64, Opera 71, Edge 79, Firefox 78, Safari 11.1, or Node.js 10\n\nYou can verify what transforms `@babel/preset-env` is using by enabling the [`debug` option](https://babeljs.io/docs/babel-preset-env#debug).\n\n\n### Patches\n\nThis problem has been fixed in `@babel/helpers` and `@babel/runtime` 7.26.10 and 8.0.0-alpha.17, please upgrade. It's likely that you do not directly depend on `@babel/helpers`, and instead you depend on `@babel/core` (which itself depends on `@babel/helpers`). Upgrading to `@babel/core` 7.26.10 is not required, but it guarantees that you are on a new enough `@babel/helpers` version.\n\nPlease note that just updating your Babel dependencies is not enough: you will also need to re-compile your code.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you are passing user-provided strings as the second argument of `.replace` on regular expressions that contain named capturing groups, validate the input and make sure it does not contain the substring `$<` if it's then not followed by `>` (possibly with other characters in between).\n\n### References\n\nThis vulnerability was reported and fixed in https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/17173.",

The vulnerability occurs because the serialize-javascript module does not properly sanitize certain inputs, such as regex or other JavaScript object types, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code. This code could be executed when deserialized by a web browser, causing Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. This issue is critical in environments where serialized data is sent to web clients, potentially compromising the security of the website or web application using this package.",

`./a/b/c/foo.txt` it would create every folder and sub-folder here a, b and c until it reaches the last folder to create `foo.txt`, In-this case I noticed that there's no validation at all on the amount of folders being created, that said we're actually able to CPU and memory consume the system running node-tar and even crash the nodejs client within few seconds of running it using a path with too many sub-folders inside\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\nYou can reproduce this issue by downloading the tar file I provided in the resources and using node-tar to extract it, you should get the same

      "details": "### Summary\n\n`tmp@0.2.3` is vulnerable to an Arbitrary temporary file / directory write via symbolic link `dir` parameter.\n\n\n### Details\n\nAccording to the documentation there are some conditions that must be held:\n\n```\n// https://github.com/raszi/node-tmp/blob/v0.2.3/README.md?plain=1#L41-L50\n\nOther breaking changes, i.e.\n\n- template must be relative to tmpdir\n- name must be relative to tmpdir\n- dir option must be relative to tmpdir //<-- this assumption can be bypassed using symlinks\n\nare still in place.\n\nIn order to override the system's tmpdir, you will have to use the newly\nintroduced tmpdir option.\n\n\n// https://github.com/raszi/node-tmp/blob/v0.2.3/README.md?plain=1#L375\n* `dir`: the optional temporary directory that must be relative to the system's default temporary directory.\n     absolute paths are fine as long as they point to a location under the system's default temporary directory.\n     Any directories along the so specified path must exist, otherwise a ENOENT error will be thrown upon access, \n     as tmp will not check the availability of the path, nor will it establish the requested path for you.\n```\n\nRelated issue: https://github.com/raszi/node-tmp/issues/207.\n\n\nThe issue occurs because `_resolvePath` does not properly handle symbolic link when resolving paths:\n```js\n// https://github.com/raszi/node-tmp/blob/v0.2.3/lib/tmp.js#L573-L579\nfunction _resolvePath(name, tmpDir) {\n  if (name.startsWith(tmpDir)) {\n    return path.resolve(name);\n  } else {\n    return path.resolve(path.join(tmpDir, name));\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf the `dir` parameter points to a symlink that resolves to a folder outside the `tmpDir`, it's possible to bypass the `_assertIsRelative` check used in `_assertAndSanitizeOptions`:\n```js\n// https://github.com/raszi/node-tmp/blob/v0.2.3/lib/tmp.js#L590-L609\nfunction _assertIsRelative(name, option, tmpDir) {\n  if (option === 'name') {\n    // assert that name is not absolute and does not contain a path\n    if (path.isAbsolute(name))\n      throw new Error(`${option} option must not contain an absolute path, found \"${name}\".`);\n    // must not fail on valid .<name> or ..<name> or similar such constructs\n    let basename = path.basename(name);\n    if (basename === '..' || basename === '.' || basename !== name)\n      throw new Error(`${option} option must not contain a path, found \"${name}\".`);\n  }\n  else { // if (option === 'dir' || option === 'template') {\n    // assert that dir or template are relative to tmpDir\n    if (path.isAbsolute(name) && !name.startsWith(tmpDir)) {\n      throw new Error(`${option} option must be relative to \"${tmpDir}\", found \"${name}\".`);\n    }\n    let resolvedPath = _resolvePath(name, tmpDir); //<--- \n    if (!resolvedPath.startsWith(tmpDir))\n      throw new Error(`${option} option must be relative to \"${tmpDir}\", found \"${resolvedPath}\".`);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n### PoC\n\nThe following PoC demonstrates how writing a tmp file on a folder outside the `tmpDir` is possible.\nTested on a Linux machine.\n\n- Setup: create a symbolic link inside the `tmpDir` that points to a directory outside of it\n```bash\nmkdir $HOME/mydir1\n\nln -s $HOME/mydir1 ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/evil-dir\n```\n\n- check the folder is empty:\n```bash\nls -lha $HOME/mydir1 | grep \"tmp-\"\n```\n\n- run the poc\n```bash\nnode main.js\nFile:  /tmp/evil-dir/tmp-26821-Vw87SLRaBIlf\ntest 1: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/tmp/mydir1/tmp-[random-id]'\ntest 2: dir option must be relative to \"/tmp\", found \"/foo\".\ntest 3: dir option must be relative to \"/tmp\", found \"/home/user/mydir1\".\n```\n\n- the temporary file is created under `$HOME/mydir1` (outside the `tmpDir`):\n```bash\nls -lha $HOME/mydir1 | grep \"tmp-\"\n-rw------- 1 user user    0 Apr  X XX:XX tmp-[random-id]\n```\n\n\n- `main.js`\n```js\n// npm i tmp@0.2.3\n\nconst tmp = require('tmp');\n\nconst tmpobj = tmp.fileSync({ 'dir': 'evil-dir'});\nconsole.log('File: ', tmpobj.name);\n\ntry {\n    tmp.fileSync({ 'dir': 'mydir1'});\n} catch (err) {\n    console.log('test 1:', err.message)\n}\n\ntry {\n    tmp.fileSync({ 'dir': '/foo'});\n} catch (err) {\n    console.log('test 2:', err.message)\n}\n\ntry {\n    const fs = require('node:fs');\n    const resolved = fs.realpathSync('/tmp/evil-dir');\n    tmp.fileSync({ 'dir': resolved});\n} catch (err) {\n    console.log('test 3:', err.message)\n}\n```\n\n\nA Potential fix could be to call `fs.realpathSync` (or similar) that resolves also symbolic links.\n```js\nfunction _resolvePath(name, tmpDir) {\n  let resolvedPath;\n  if (name.startsWith(tmpDir)) {\n    resolvedPath = path.resolve(name);\n  } else {\n    resolvedPath = path.resolve(path.join(tmpDir, name));\n  }\n  return fs.realpathSync(resolvedPath);\n}\n```\n\n\n### Impact\n\nArbitrary temporary file / directory write via symlink",

You can do this by deleting it from your package manager's lockfile and re-installing the dependencies. `@babel/core` >=7.23.2 will automatically pull in a non-vulnerable version.\n- If you cannot upgrade `@babel/traverse` and are using one of the affected packages mentioned above, upgrade them to their latest version to avoid triggering the vulnerable code path in affected `@babel/traverse` versions:\n  - `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime` v7.23.2\n  - `@babel/preset-env` v7.23.2\n  - `@babel/helper-define-polyfill-provider` v0.4.3\n  - `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs2` v0.4.6\n  - `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs3` v0.8.5\n  - `babel-plugin-polyfill-es-shims` v0.10.0\n  - `babel-plugin-polyfill-regenerator` v0.5.3",

Reduce the maximum allowed length of the request headers using the [`--max-http-header-size=size`][] and/or the [`maxHeaderSize`][] options so that no more headers than the `server.maxHeadersCount` limit can be sent.\n2. Set `server.maxHeadersCount` to `0` so that no limit is applied.\n\n### Credits\n\nThe vulnerability was reported by [Ryan LaPointe](https://github.com/rrlapointe) in https://github.com/websockets/ws/issues/2230.\n\n### References\n\n- https://github.com/websockets/ws/issues/2230\n- https://github.com/websockets/ws/pull/2231\n\n[`--max-http-header-size=size`]: https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--max-http-header-sizesize\n[`maxHeaderSize`]: https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#httpcreateserveroptions-requestlistener\n[`server.maxHeadersCount`]: https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#servermaxheaderscount\n",
