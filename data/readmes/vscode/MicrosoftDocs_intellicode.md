## 🚨 IntelliCode Extensions for VS Code Are Being Deprecated

We are officially deprecating the **VS Code IntelliCode extensions**. This includes:
- [IntelliCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioExptTeam.vscodeintellicode)
- [IntelliCode Completions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioExptTeam.vscodeintellicode-completions)
- [IntelliCode for C# Dev Kit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vms-dotnettools.vscodeintellicode-csharp)
- [IntelliCode API Usage Examples](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioExptTeam.intellicode-api-usage-examples)

### What this means:
- No new features will be added.
- Bug fixes and support will end immediately. 
- The extensions will be marked as deprecated and this repo archived.

### What stays the same:
- You will **still get language-server powered completions** in VS Code. 
- For AI-assisted coding, we recommend using [**GitHub Copilot**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat), which provides advanced suggestions and inline completions.

### Recommended Action:
Uninstall the IntelliCode extensions for VS Code and either use built-in language server support or install GitHub Copilot for enhanced productivity.

Thank you for your support!
