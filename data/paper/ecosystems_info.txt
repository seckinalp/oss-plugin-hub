1. Browser EcosystemsChrome Web Store (CWS)Chrome remains the most commercially standardized ecosystem, with a high barrier to entry designed to curb spam and malware.Timeline: Automated reviews for low-permission tools take 24–48 hours. Extensions with broad host permissions (e.g., <all_urls>) trigger manual audits lasting 7 to 30 days.2025 Manifest V3 Policy: Chrome has fully transitioned to Manifest V3. This forbids "remotely hosted code," requiring all logic to be bundled within the extension package. This prevents "silent" supply-chain updates.Privacy Sandbox (2025 Q1): New requirements for data attestation and enrollment for any extension using the Privacy Sandbox APIs for ad measurement or tracking.Cost: A one-time $5 developer fee and mandatory 2FA for all publisher accounts.Firefox Add-ons (AMO)Mozilla’s ecosystem is built on transparency, making it the most "OSS-friendly" of the browser stores.Timeline: Initial reviews are manual and can take 1 to 2 weeks. Once a publisher is trusted, automated updates are approved in minutes.Source Code Mandate: If code is minified or transpiled (e.g., via TypeScript or Webpack), developers must provide the original source code and build instructions. Reviewers must be able to reproduce the build exactly.Data Collection (Nov 2025): A new manifest key browser_specific_settings.gecko.data_collection_permissions is now mandatory for new extensions to declare personal data handling.2. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)Visual Studio Code (VS Code)VS Code is a "high-velocity" registry that favors automation over manual gatekeeping.Timeline: Almost entirely automated. New submissions and updates go live in 15 to 30 minutes.Security: Uses automated antivirus scanning and "Secret Scanning" to block publishing if API keys or tokens are detected in the code.Verified Publishers: A domain-proven blue checkmark is required for enterprise-level trust. This correlates with your study's high Workflow Intensity as most top-tier tools use GitHub Actions for automated publishing.JetBrains MarketplaceJetBrains represents the "Professional/High-Quality" archetype, requiring strict technical hygiene.Timeline: A hybrid review process (Automation + Manual) usually takes 2 business days.The Plugin Verifier: Mandatory binary compatibility checks. If a plugin uses deprecated or internal APIs for a specific IDE version, it is automatically rejected.Unified Distribution (2025.3): A recent architectural shift merging IDE cores has forced a massive maintenance cycle for all top-100 plugins to remain compatible.Sublime Text (Package Control)The only truly decentralized, volunteer-run registry in the list.Timeline: Initial listing requires a Manual Pull Request to a GitHub repository, taking 1 to 5 days.Process: Once listed, a crawler checks the developer's GitHub/Bitbucket repository every hour for new SemVer tags. Updates are pushed to users automatically without further review.De Facto OSS: Since it points directly to Git repos, it has the highest OSS availability in your dataset.3. Content Management & Specialized ToolsWordPress.orgWordPress is a legal and technical fortress, maintaining code on its own SVN servers.Timeline: Manual reviews by volunteers currently take 7 to 30 days depending on the queue. Updates are instant via SVN.GPL Mandate: All code must be GPLv2 compatible. You cannot host "trialware" or "obfuscated" code.PCP Tooling (2025): The "Plugin Check" tool is now the standard for pre-submission, scanning for security nonces and sanitization.Minecraft (Modrinth)A modern, "Open Source First" platform built to replace legacy gaming registries.Timeline: Manual moderation is required for all new projects (48–96 hours).Metadata (Aug 2025): Mandatory categorization of "Client-side" vs. "Server-side" logic to prevent installation crashes.Honesty Policy: Strictly forbids technical jargon in descriptions. Projects must provide a clear "Why download this?" summary.ObsidianA highly curated repository-based marketplace.Timeline: Initial entry via PR to obsidian-releases on GitHub takes 1 to 2 weeks. Updates are automated via GitHub releases.Security: Reviewers manually audit the main.js for "Desktop Risk" (filesystem/network access). No external runtime dependencies are allowed.Home Assistant (HACS)HACS is a community-run bridge that turns GitHub into a store.Timeline: Instant for "Custom" repos; 1 to 2 weeks for "Default Store" inclusion via PR.Requirement: Mandatory hacs.json manifest and GitHub Releases usage. It is the most "Forge-Native" ecosystem in your research.Policy Comparison Matrix (2025)PlatformReview TypeSource PolicyCostPrimary Trust SignalChromeAutomated/RiskNo Obfuscation$5Manifest V3 ComplianceFirefoxManual InitialSource RequiredFreeHuman Code ReviewVS CodeAutomatedOptionalFreeVerified Publisher CheckJetBrainsHybridCustom EULAFreePlugin Verifier ReportWordPressManualGPL MandatoryFreeSanitization/SVN HistorySublimePR-basedForge-hostedFreeCommunity PR MergeModrinthManual"Clear & Honest"FreeModeration DiscussionObsidianManual InitialBundled JSFreeDesktop Security AuditHACSPR/AutomatedGitHub ReleaseFreeHACS Manifest Check
