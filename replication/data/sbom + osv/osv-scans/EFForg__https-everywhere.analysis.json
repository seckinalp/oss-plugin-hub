This is roughly equivalent to any sort of improper escaping vulnerability, with the caveat that the attacker must find a way to observe other Math.random() values generated by the application to solve for the state of the PRNG. However, Math.random() is used in all sorts of places that might be visible to an attacker (including by form-data itself, if the attacker can arrange for the vulnerable application to make a request to an attacker-controlled server using form-data, such as a user-controlled webhook -- the attacker could observe the boundary values from those requests to observe the Math.random() outputs). A common example would be a `x-request-id` header added by the server. These sorts of headers are often used for distributed tracing, to correlate errors across the frontend and backend. `Math.random()` is a fine place to get these sorts of IDs (in fact, [opentelemetry uses Math.random for this purpose](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/blob/2053f0d3a44631ade77ea04f656056a2c8a2ae76/packages/opentelemetry-sdk-trace-base/src/platform/node/RandomIdGenerator.ts#L22))\n\n### PoC\n\nPoC here: https://github.com/benweissmann/CVE-2025-7783-poc\n\nInstructions are in that repo.

The attacker must be able to do something malicious by adding extra parameters (that were not intended to be user-controlled) to this request. Depending on the target system's handling of repeated parameters, the attacker might be able to overwrite values in addition to appending values (some multipart form handlers deal with repeats by overwriting values instead of representing them as an array)\n- Reveal values of Math.random(). It's easiest if the attacker can observe multiple sequential values, but more complex math could recover the PRNG state to some degree of confidence with non-sequential values. \n\nIf an application is vulnerable, this allows an attacker to make arbitrary requests to internal systems.",

      "details": "### Impact\n\nWhen using Babel to compile [regular expression named capturing groups](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Named_capturing_group), Babel will generate a polyfill for the `.replace` method that has quadratic complexity on some specific replacement pattern strings (i.e. the second argument passed to `.replace`).\n\nYour generated code is vulnerable if _all_ the following conditions are true:\n- You use Babel to compile [regular expression named capturing groups](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Named_capturing_group)\n- You use the `.replace` method on a regular expression that contains named capturing groups\n- **Your code uses untrusted strings as the second argument of `.replace`**\n\nIf you are using `@babel/preset-env` with the [`targets`](https://babeljs.io/docs/options#targets) option, the transform that injects the vulnerable code is automatically enabled if:\n- you use [_duplicated_ named capturing groups](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-duplicate-named-capturing-groups), and target any browser older than Chrome/Edge 126, Opera 112, Firefox 129, Safari 17.4, or Node.js 23\n- you use any [named capturing groups](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Named_capturing_group), and target any browser older than Chrome 64, Opera 71, Edge 79, Firefox 78, Safari 11.1, or Node.js 10\n\nYou can verify what transforms `@babel/preset-env` is using by enabling the [`debug` option](https://babeljs.io/docs/babel-preset-env#debug).\n\n\n### Patches\n\nThis problem has been fixed in `@babel/helpers` and `@babel/runtime` 7.26.10 and 8.0.0-alpha.17, please upgrade. It's likely that you do not directly depend on `@babel/helpers`, and instead you depend on `@babel/core` (which itself depends on `@babel/helpers`). Upgrading to `@babel/core` 7.26.10 is not required, but it guarantees that you are on a new enough `@babel/helpers` version.\n\nPlease note that just updating your Babel dependencies is not enough: you will also need to re-compile your code.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you are passing user-provided strings as the second argument of `.replace` on regular expressions that contain named capturing groups, validate the input and make sure it does not contain the substring `$<` if it's then not followed by `>` (possibly with other characters in between).\n\n### References\n\nThis vulnerability was reported and fixed in https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/17173.",

      "summary": "Prototype Pollution in JSON5 via Parse Method",
      "details": "The `parse` method of the JSON5 library before and including version `2.2.1` does not restrict parsing of keys named `__proto__`, allowing specially crafted strings to pollute the prototype of the resulting object.\n\nThis vulnerability pollutes the prototype of the object returned by `JSON5.parse` and not the global Object prototype, which is the commonly understood definition of Prototype Pollution. However, polluting the prototype of a single object can have significant security impact for an application if the object is later used in trusted operations.\n\n## Impact\nThis vulnerability could allow an attacker to set arbitrary and unexpected keys on the object returned from `JSON5.parse`. The actual impact will depend on how applications utilize the returned object and how they filter unwanted keys, but could include denial of service, cross-site scripting, elevation of privilege, and in extreme cases, remote code execution.\n\n## Mitigation\nThis vulnerability is patched in json5 v2.2.2 and later. A patch has also been backported for json5 v1 in versions v1.0.2 and later.\n\n## Details\n \nSuppose a developer wants to allow users and admins to perform some risky operation, but they want to restrict what non-admins can do. To accomplish this, they accept a JSON blob from the user, parse it using `JSON5.parse`, confirm that the provided data does not set some sensitive keys, and then performs the risky operation using the validated data:\n \n```js\nconst JSON5 = require('json5');\n\nconst doSomethingDangerous = (props) => {\n  if (props.isAdmin) {\n    console.log('Doing dangerous thing as admin.');\n  } else {\n    console.log('Doing dangerous thing as user.');\n  }\n};\n\nconst secCheckKeysSet = (obj, searchKeys) => {\n  let searchKeyFound = false;\n  Object.keys(obj).forEach((key) => {\n    if (searchKeys.indexOf(key) > -1) {\n      searchKeyFound = true;\n    }\n  });\n  return searchKeyFound;\n};\n\nconst props = JSON5.parse('{\"foo\": \"bar\"}');\nif (!secCheckKeysSet(props, ['isAdmin', 'isMod'])) {\n  doSomethingDangerous(props); // \"Doing dangerous thing as user.\"\n} else {\n  throw new Error('Forbidden...');\n}\n```\n \nIf the user attempts to set the `isAdmin` key, their request will be rejected:\n \n```js\nconst props = JSON5.parse('{\"foo\": \"bar\", \"isAdmin\": true}');\nif (!secCheckKeysSet(props, ['isAdmin', 'isMod'])) {\n  doSomethingDangerous(props);\n} else {\n  throw new Error('Forbidden...'); // Error: Forbidden...\n}\n```\n \nHowever, users can instead set the `__proto__` key to `{\"isAdmin\": true}`. `JSON5` will parse this key and will set the `isAdmin` key on the prototype of the returned object, allowing the user to bypass the security check and run their request as an admin:\n \n```js\nconst props = JSON5.parse('{\"foo\": \"bar\", \"__proto__\": {\"isAdmin\": true}}');\nif (!secCheckKeysSet(props, ['isAdmin', 'isMod'])) {\n  doSomethingDangerous(props); // \"Doing dangerous thing as admin.\"\n} else {\n  throw new Error('Forbidden...');\n}\n ```",

All other users should upgrade to `8.0.0`.\n\nThese versions add backtrack protection when a custom regex pattern is not provided:\n\n- [0.1.10](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v0.1.10)\n- [1.9.0](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v1.9.0)\n- [3.3.0](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v3.3.0)\n- [6.3.0](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v6.3.0)\n\nThey do not protect against vulnerable user supplied capture groups. Protecting against explicit user patterns is out of scope for old versions and not considered a vulnerability.\n\nVersion [7.1.0](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v7.1.0) can enable `strict: true` and get an error when the regular expression might be bad.\n\nVersion [8.0.0](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v8.0.0) removes the features that can cause a ReDoS.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAll versions can be patched by providing a custom regular expression for parameters after the first in a single segment. As long as the custom regular expression does not match the text before the parameter, you will be safe. For example, change `/:a-:b` to `/:a-:b([^-/]+)`.\n\nIf paths cannot be rewritten and versions cannot be upgraded, another alternative is to limit the URL length. For example, halving the attack string improves performance by 4x faster.\n\n### Details\n\nUsing `/:a-:b` will produce the regular expression `/^\\/([^\\/]+?)-([^\\/]+?)\\/?$/`. This can be exploited by a path such as `/a${'-a'.repeat(8_000)}/a`. [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS) has a good example of why this occurs, but the TL;DR is the `/a` at the end ensures this route would never match but due to naive backtracking it will still attempt every combination of the `:a-:b` on the repeated 8,000 `-a`.\n\nBecause JavaScript is single threaded and regex matching runs on the main thread, poor performance will block the event loop and can lead to a DoS. In local benchmarks, exploiting the unsafe regex will result in performance that is over 1000x worse than the safe regex. In a more realistic environment using Express v4 and 10 concurrent connections, this translated to average latency of ~600ms vs 1ms.\n\n### References\n\n* [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS)\n* [Detailed blog post](https://blakeembrey.com/posts/2024-09-web-redos/)",

      "details": "### Impact\n\nWhen using Babel to compile [regular expression named capturing groups](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Named_capturing_group), Babel will generate a polyfill for the `.replace` method that has quadratic complexity on some specific replacement pattern strings (i.e. the second argument passed to `.replace`).\n\nYour generated code is vulnerable if _all_ the following conditions are true:\n- You use Babel to compile [regular expression named capturing groups](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Named_capturing_group)\n- You use the `.replace` method on a regular expression that contains named capturing groups\n- **Your code uses untrusted strings as the second argument of `.replace`**\n\nIf you are using `@babel/preset-env` with the [`targets`](https://babeljs.io/docs/options#targets) option, the transform that injects the vulnerable code is automatically enabled if:\n- you use [_duplicated_ named capturing groups](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-duplicate-named-capturing-groups), and target any browser older than Chrome/Edge 126, Opera 112, Firefox 129, Safari 17.4, or Node.js 23\n- you use any [named capturing groups](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Named_capturing_group), and target any browser older than Chrome 64, Opera 71, Edge 79, Firefox 78, Safari 11.1, or Node.js 10\n\nYou can verify what transforms `@babel/preset-env` is using by enabling the [`debug` option](https://babeljs.io/docs/babel-preset-env#debug).\n\n\n### Patches\n\nThis problem has been fixed in `@babel/helpers` and `@babel/runtime` 7.26.10 and 8.0.0-alpha.17, please upgrade. It's likely that you do not directly depend on `@babel/helpers`, and instead you depend on `@babel/core` (which itself depends on `@babel/helpers`). Upgrading to `@babel/core` 7.26.10 is not required, but it guarantees that you are on a new enough `@babel/helpers` version.\n\nPlease note that just updating your Babel dependencies is not enough: you will also need to re-compile your code.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you are passing user-provided strings as the second argument of `.replace` on regular expressions that contain named capturing groups, validate the input and make sure it does not contain the substring `$<` if it's then not followed by `>` (possibly with other characters in between).\n\n### References\n\nThis vulnerability was reported and fixed in https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/17173.",

      "details": "### Summary\n\n`tmp@0.2.3` is vulnerable to an Arbitrary temporary file / directory write via symbolic link `dir` parameter.\n\n\n### Details\n\nAccording to the documentation there are some conditions that must be held:\n\n```\n// https://github.com/raszi/node-tmp/blob/v0.2.3/README.md?plain=1#L41-L50\n\nOther breaking changes, i.e.\n\n- template must be relative to tmpdir\n- name must be relative to tmpdir\n- dir option must be relative to tmpdir //<-- this assumption can be bypassed using symlinks\n\nare still in place.\n\nIn order to override the system's tmpdir, you will have to use the newly\nintroduced tmpdir option.\n\n\n// https://github.com/raszi/node-tmp/blob/v0.2.3/README.md?plain=1#L375\n* `dir`: the optional temporary directory that must be relative to the system's default temporary directory.\n     absolute paths are fine as long as they point to a location under the system's default temporary directory.\n     Any directories along the so specified path must exist, otherwise a ENOENT error will be thrown upon access, \n     as tmp will not check the availability of the path, nor will it establish the requested path for you.\n```\n\nRelated issue: https://github.com/raszi/node-tmp/issues/207.\n\n\nThe issue occurs because `_resolvePath` does not properly handle symbolic link when resolving paths:\n```js\n// https://github.com/raszi/node-tmp/blob/v0.2.3/lib/tmp.js#L573-L579\nfunction _resolvePath(name, tmpDir) {\n  if (name.startsWith(tmpDir)) {\n    return path.resolve(name);\n  } else {\n    return path.resolve(path.join(tmpDir, name));\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf the `dir` parameter points to a symlink that resolves to a folder outside the `tmpDir`, it's possible to bypass the `_assertIsRelative` check used in `_assertAndSanitizeOptions`:\n```js\n// https://github.com/raszi/node-tmp/blob/v0.2.3/lib/tmp.js#L590-L609\nfunction _assertIsRelative(name, option, tmpDir) {\n  if (option === 'name') {\n    // assert that name is not absolute and does not contain a path\n    if (path.isAbsolute(name))\n      throw new Error(`${option} option must not contain an absolute path, found \"${name}\".`);\n    // must not fail on valid .<name> or ..<name> or similar such constructs\n    let basename = path.basename(name);\n    if (basename === '..' || basename === '.' || basename !== name)\n      throw new Error(`${option} option must not contain a path, found \"${name}\".`);\n  }\n  else { // if (option === 'dir' || option === 'template') {\n    // assert that dir or template are relative to tmpDir\n    if (path.isAbsolute(name) && !name.startsWith(tmpDir)) {\n      throw new Error(`${option} option must be relative to \"${tmpDir}\", found \"${name}\".`);\n    }\n    let resolvedPath = _resolvePath(name, tmpDir); //<--- \n    if (!resolvedPath.startsWith(tmpDir))\n      throw new Error(`${option} option must be relative to \"${tmpDir}\", found \"${resolvedPath}\".`);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n### PoC\n\nThe following PoC demonstrates how writing a tmp file on a folder outside the `tmpDir` is possible.\nTested on a Linux machine.\n\n- Setup: create a symbolic link inside the `tmpDir` that points to a directory outside of it\n```bash\nmkdir $HOME/mydir1\n\nln -s $HOME/mydir1 ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/evil-dir\n```\n\n- check the folder is empty:\n```bash\nls -lha $HOME/mydir1 | grep \"tmp-\"\n```\n\n- run the poc\n```bash\nnode main.js\nFile:  /tmp/evil-dir/tmp-26821-Vw87SLRaBIlf\ntest 1: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/tmp/mydir1/tmp-[random-id]'\ntest 2: dir option must be relative to \"/tmp\", found \"/foo\".\ntest 3: dir option must be relative to \"/tmp\", found \"/home/user/mydir1\".\n```\n\n- the temporary file is created under `$HOME/mydir1` (outside the `tmpDir`):\n```bash\nls -lha $HOME/mydir1 | grep \"tmp-\"\n-rw------- 1 user user    0 Apr  X XX:XX tmp-[random-id]\n```\n\n\n- `main.js`\n```js\n// npm i tmp@0.2.3\n\nconst tmp = require('tmp');\n\nconst tmpobj = tmp.fileSync({ 'dir': 'evil-dir'});\nconsole.log('File: ', tmpobj.name);\n\ntry {\n    tmp.fileSync({ 'dir': 'mydir1'});\n} catch (err) {\n    console.log('test 1:', err.message)\n}\n\ntry {\n    tmp.fileSync({ 'dir': '/foo'});\n} catch (err) {\n    console.log('test 2:', err.message)\n}\n\ntry {\n    const fs = require('node:fs');\n    const resolved = fs.realpathSync('/tmp/evil-dir');\n    tmp.fileSync({ 'dir': resolved});\n} catch (err) {\n    console.log('test 3:', err.message)\n}\n```\n\n\nA Potential fix could be to call `fs.realpathSync` (or similar) that resolves also symbolic links.\n```js\nfunction _resolvePath(name, tmpDir) {\n  let resolvedPath;\n  if (name.startsWith(tmpDir)) {\n    resolvedPath = path.resolve(name);\n  } else {\n    resolvedPath = path.resolve(path.join(tmpDir, name));\n  }\n  return fs.realpathSync(resolvedPath);\n}\n```\n\n\n### Impact\n\nArbitrary temporary file / directory write via symlink",

      "details": "### Impact\n\nUsing Babel to compile code that was specifically crafted by an attacker can lead to arbitrary code execution during compilation, when using plugins that rely on the `path.evaluate()`or `path.evaluateTruthy()` internal Babel methods.\n\nKnown affected plugins are:\n- `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime`\n- `@babel/preset-env` when using its [`useBuiltIns`](https://babeljs.io/docs/babel-preset-env#usebuiltins) option\n- Any \"polyfill provider\" plugin that depends on `@babel/helper-define-polyfill-provider`, such as `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs3`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs2`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-es-shims`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-regenerator`\n\nNo other plugins under the `@babel/` namespace are impacted, but third-party plugins might be.\n\n**Users that only compile trusted code are not impacted.**\n\n### Patches\n\nThe vulnerability has been fixed in `@babel/traverse@7.23.2`.\n\nBabel 6 does not receive security fixes anymore (see [Babel's security policy](https://github.com/babel/babel/security/policy)), hence there is no patch planned for `babel-traverse@6`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\n- Upgrade `@babel/traverse` to v7.23.2 or higher. You can do this by deleting it from your package manager's lockfile and re-installing the dependencies. `@babel/core` >=7.23.2 will automatically pull in a non-vulnerable version.\n- If you cannot upgrade `@babel/traverse` and are using one of the affected packages mentioned above, upgrade them to their latest version to avoid triggering the vulnerable code path in affected `@babel/traverse` versions:\n  - `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime` v7.23.2\n  - `@babel/preset-env` v7.23.2\n  - `@babel/helper-define-polyfill-provider` v0.4.3\n  - `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs2` v0.4.6\n  - `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs3` v0.8.5\n  - `babel-plugin-polyfill-es-shims` v0.10.0\n  - `babel-plugin-polyfill-regenerator` v0.5.3",
