To achieve this compromise attempt, the attacker must send a link with a `redirect_uri` that they control to the victim’s own Home Assistant instance. In the eventuality the victim authenticates via said link, the attacker would obtain code sent to the specified URL in `redirect_uri`, which can then be leveraged to fetch an `access_token`.

Tests showed that this occurs when:\n\n- The request is not authenticated and\n- The request originated locally, meaning on the Home Assistant host local subnet or any other private subnet (`10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16, fd00::/8, ::ffff:10.0.0.0/104, ::ffff:172.16.0.0/108, ::ffff:192.168.0.0/112`)\n\nThe rationale behind this is to make the login more user-friendly (see [release blog post](https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2023/12/06/release-202312/)) and an experience better aligned with other applications that have multiple user-profiles.\n\nHowever, as a result, all accounts are displayed regardless of them having logged in or not and for any device that navigates to the server. This disclosure is mitigated by the fact that it only occurs for requests originating from a LAN address. But note that this applies to the local subnet where Home Assistant resides and to any private subnet that can reach it.\n\n### PoC\n\n1. Place a Home Assistant instance on a private subnet, i.e., 192.168.1.0/24.\n2. Create a few users, let's say, three.\n3. From any (or another) private subnet on the LAN, like 192.168.2.0/24, open an incognito browser window (to ensure that the browser has no cookies from Home Assistant and therefore is demonstrably unauthenticated) and navigate to the Home Assistant URL.\n4. The login page will display all three users, including their profile photo.\n\n### Impact\n\nThe following CVSS string could be shaped to describe the overall impact of this issue:\nAV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N\n\nAs seen, the Exploitability metrics are high, and the Impact metrics are low. This is fitting because the problem does not constitute a critical one, but at the same time, it is trivial to exploit. Still, since the mitigation can be so easily implemented in code to eliminate a typical case of information disclosure, it would certainly be worth pursuing.\n",

      "details": "## Summary\n\nProblem: Potential man-in-the-middle attacks due to missing SSL certificate verification in the project codebase and used third-party libraries.\n\n## Details\n\nIn the past, `aiohttp-session`/`request` had the parameter `verify_ssl` to control SSL certificate verification. This was a boolean value. In `aiohttp` 3.0, this parameter was deprecated in favor of the `ssl` parameter. Only when `ssl` is set to `None` or provided with a correct configured SSL context the standard SSL certificate verification will happen.\n\nWhen migrating integrations in Home Assistant and libraries used by Home Assistant, in some cases the `verify_ssl` parameter value was just moved to the new `ssl` parameter. This resulted in these integrations and 3rd party libraries using `request.ssl = True`, which unintentionally turned off SSL certificate verification and opened up a man-in-the-middle attack vector.\n\nExample:\nhttps://github.com/home-assistant/core/blob/c4411914c2e906105b765c00af5740bd0880e946/homeassistant/components/discord/notify.py#L84\n\nWhen you scan the libraries used by the integrations in Home Assistant, you will find more issues like this.\n\nThe general handling in Home Assistant looks good, as `homeassistant.helpers.aoihttp_client._async_get_connector` handles it correctly.\n\n## PoC\n\n1. Check that expired.badssl.com:443 gives an SSL error in when connecting with curl or browser.\n2. Add the integration adguard with the setting `host=expired.badssl.com`, `port=443`, `use-ssl=true`, `verify-ssl=true`.\n3. Check the logs - you get a HTTP 403 response.\n\nExpected behavior:\n1. The integration log shows an `ssl.SSLCertVerificationError`.\n\nThe following code shows the problem with `ssl=True`. No exception is raised when `ssl=True` (Python 3.11.6).\n\n```\nimport asyncio\nfrom ssl import SSLCertVerificationError\n\nimport aiohttp\n\nBAD_URL = \"https://expired.badssl.com/\"\n\n\nasync def run_request(verify_ssl, result_placeholder: str):\n    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:\n        exception_fired: bool = False\n        try:\n            await session.request(\"OPTIONS\", BAD_URL, ssl=verify_ssl)\n        except SSLCertVerificationError:\n            exception_fired = True\n        except Exception as error:\n            print(error)\n        else:\n            exception_fired = False\n        print(result_placeholder.format(exception_result=exception_fired))\n\n\n# Case 1: ssl=False --> expected result: No exception\nasyncio.run(run_request(False, \"Test case 1: expected result: False - result: {exception_result}\"))\n\n# Case 2: ssl=None --> expected result: Exception\nasyncio.run(run_request(None, \"Test case 2: expected result: True - result: {exception_result}\"))\n\n# Case 3: ssl=True --> expected result: No Exception\nasyncio.run(run_request(True, \"Test case 3: expected result: False - result: {exception_result}\"))\n\n```",
