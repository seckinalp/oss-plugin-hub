Specifically crafted URL values allow commands to be executed in the HgDriver if hg/Mercurial is installed on the system.\n\n### Impact\n- The impact to Composer users directly is limited as the composer.json file is typically under their own control and source download URLs can only be supplied by third party Composer repositories they explicitly trust to download and execute source code from, e.g. Composer plugins.\n- The main impact is to services passing user input to Composer, including Packagist.org and Private Packagist. This allowed users to trigger remote command injection. The vulnerability has been patched on Packagist.org and Private Packagist within 12h of receiving the initial vulnerability report and based on a review of logs, to the best of our knowledge, was not abused by anyone.\n- Other services/tools using VcsRepository/VcsDriver or derivatives may also be vulnerable and should upgrade their composer/composer dependency immediately\n\n### Patches\n1.10.22 and 2.0.13 include patches for this issue.",

It can be leveraged to gain arbitrary command execution if the Mercurial or the Git driver are used.\n\nThis led to a vulnerability on Packagist.org and Private Packagist, i.e., using the composer.json `readme` field as a vector for injecting parameters into the `$file` argument for the Mercurial driver or via the `$identifier` argument for the Git and Mercurial drivers.\n\nComposer itself can be attacked through branch names by anyone controlling a Git or Mercurial repository, which is explicitly listed by URL in a project's composer.json.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, this was not actively exploited. The vulnerability has been patched on Packagist.org and Private Packagist within a day of the vulnerability report.",
